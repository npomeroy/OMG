### Processing Timeline

Approximately 25 units or 50 CAU plates can be processed as a batch (at ESD-CREP, this is equivalent to CAUs collected from about 1 island). The processing of each batch is typically completed in 4 weeks. Below is an example of a typical processing timeline 


`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CAU_table.jpg"))`


### Preparation Work

**ID Tags**

1.	Assign a unique ID to both plates of each Calcification Accretion Unit (CAU) using the **CAU Plate ID** naming convention SiteID_RecoveryYear_4-digitSerial#_PlateLocation (“U” - upper plate, “L” - lower plate)  

    e.g. PAL01_2012_5319_U  
                PAL01_2012_5319_L

2.	Using a pencil, **pre-label the following with the CAU Plate ID (e.g. PAL01_2012_5319_U):**  
  
    a.	Paper tray A - blank index card 12.7 x 20.32cm (5” x 8”) folded into 12.7 x 12.7cm (5” x 5”) paper tray  
    b.	Paper tray B - same as above  
    c.	Filterpaper 11cm diameter, #1, >11μm particle retention (e.g. Whatman No.1001-110)

3.	Insert the corresponding Filter paper into the fold of Paper tray B and store in a container. Place Paper tray A in a separate container. Store both containers away from moisture and direct sunlight. See I. Step 8 for pre-weighing instructions. 

4.	Print **Glass Dish Labels** on waterproof paper using the template below. Attach each label on one side of the glass dish with tape.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Template1.jpg"))`

5.	Print the Plate Photo ID tags on waterproof paper using the template below.There are 4 tags, one for each surface of the CAU to be photographed:  
  
    **Upper Plate, Top Side**  
    **Upper Plate, Bottom Side**  
    **Lower Plate, Top Side**  
    **Lower Plate, Bottom Side**   
	
    An example of a plate photo ID: *PAL01_2012_5319_U_T*

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Template2.jpg"))`

6.	Using an analytical balance, **pre-weigh** the following and record the value (up to 3 decimal points) in the ESD Apex CAU Mission App (or the CAU Data Entry tool for ESD-CREP users, see Section VI p. 20):  

    a. Paper tray A - record the value in Column (‘Paper Tray A Weight [g]’)  
    b. Paper tray B + Filterpaper - record the value in Column (‘Filter & Paper Tray B Dry Weight  [g]’)  

**Re-sealable Bag ID**

Pre-label **re-sealable plastic bags** 0.95L (1 quart) with the CAU Plate ID. The filter residue will be stored in this bag for archiving

**Database**

1. Using the **ESD Apex CAU Mission App** (or the CAU Data Entry tool for ESD-CREP users, see Section VI p. 20), have the Data Management team enter the CAU Site IDs (e.g. *PAL01*) and 4-digit CAU Serial #s (e.g. *5319*) for each unit to be processed


2. To calculate the **“Soak Time”** of each unit, record the CAU “Deployment Date” and “Recovery Date” in Column CA and CB, respectively. Record any other additional field data in the spreadsheet (e.g. coordinates, depth, comments, etc.). When using the ESD Apex CAU Mission App, soak time is calculated automatically.

**Pre-heat Drying Oven**

Oven (Heratherm OGS-180) settings:  

    Temperature: 70°C (140°F)  
    Damper: level 3 (mid-high)  
    
**Prepare 5% HCl acid solution in 2-liter bottles** 

One batch (20-30 units) of CAUs will require about 10-15, 2-liter bottles of 5% HCl acid solution in order to completely dissolve calcified materials. More may be needed depending on the amount of accreted CaCO3.  
	
	
	
To dilute full-strength HCl acid (1.18 g/mL, 36.5 molar mass, 37% conc.) into 5% solution, use the recommended ratio below:  

    2L stock: 225 ml HCl  
         1775 ml deionized/distilled H2O  
	
    1L stock: 112.5 ml HCl  
         887.5 ml deionized/distilled H2O  



** Be sure to **ADD ACID TO WATER** to avoid excessive heating, violent boiling or splashing of concentrated acid that could result from the exothermic reaction. 
“Do as you oughta, add acid to water!” - Dr. Anne Cohen, WHOI    
 

** Acid solutions with a higher (>5% HCl concentration) may be prepared and used if desired for processing CAUs from heavily calcified regions (American Samoa, PRIAs), however concentrations **greater than or equal to 15% HCl require special PPE including fume hood utilization.**

### CAU Processing Steps

*see Section IV, p.11 for sample processing timeline and Section VII.A, p.36 for sample daily task guide*


#### Dissassembling and Photo-documentation

1.	Thaw a batch of CAUs (typically 20-30 units) in the sink for at least 12 hours. Do not thaw over water.

2.	Disassemble the plates of each CAU by removing the hex nuts and washers using two 1/4" wrenches (one to hold the unit steady). Make sure to maintain plate identity (upper vs lower plate, top vs bottom side of plate) and the CAU Plate ID.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CAU_plate_ID.jpg"))`

3.	Carefully rinse each plate in a saltwater rinse basin (if saltwater is not readily available, freshwater may be used) to remove loose sediment, sand and mobile fauna. Discard any mobile fauna that may have fallen off during rinsing.

4.	Fill each pre-labeled glass dish with saltwater(or freshwater). 

5.	Place each CAU plate with the **top plate facing upwards** into its corresponding glass dish. Ensure that the plate and any encrusting fauna are completely submerged in water. Add more water if necessary (see Section V.C for additional instructions)

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CAU_dried.jpg"))`

6.	Attach a DSLR camera to a camera copy stand or a tripod. Arrange lighting such that the plate is fully illuminated and no glare is visible to the camera 

** *If using a Nikon D7000 camera mounted on a copy stand kit with attached lights, see Section V, p. 12 for tethering protocol and recommended settings (**f/8, ISO400, AWB**).*

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CAU_photograph.jpg"))`

7.	It is recommended to tether the camera to a computer and save the photos directly to the computer’s local drive (while using the camera’s SD card as a backup drive). Designate a folder where the CAU photoset will be stored directly. 

** May 2019 - ESD General (T:) Drive Organized by Year and Cruise Mission, or Island Code for shore-based missions or those from the Atlantict: 

    T:\Oceanography\CAUs\Analysis

8.	Photograph the top and bottom of each plate, first with the Plate Photo ID tag and then a 2nd image without the tag. (If pieces of calcified material fall off during the photographing process, retain the pieces with the plate to be used during the decalcification process).

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CAU_image.jpg"))`

9.	From the designated CAU photoset folder, confirm that both plate photos (with and without the Plate Photo ID tag) are in focus. After photographing both sides of each plate, each CAU photoset folder should have **8 photos**. The photos should be later on renamed with the following naming convention:  

    **a.	With Plate Photo ID tag:**
    SiteID_RecoveryYear_4-digitSerial#_PlateLocation (“U” - upper plate or “L” - lower plate)_PlateSurface (“T” - top plate or “B” - bottom plate)_ID.jpg    

    **b.	Without Plate Photo ID tag:**  
    SiteID_RecoveryYear_4-digitSerial#_PlateLocation (“U” - upper plate, “L”  lower plate)_PlateSurface (“T” - top plate, “B” - bottom plate).jpg  

    Example:  
    
    PAL01_2012_5319_U_T_ID.jpg		– Upper Plate, Top Side with tag  
    PAL01_2012_5319_U_T.jpg			  – Upper Plate, Top Side  
    PAL01_2012_5319_U_B_ID.jpg		– Upper Plate, Bottom   Side with tag  
    PAL01_2012_5319_U_B.jpg		    – Upper Plate, Bottom Side  
    PAL01_2012_5319_L_T_ID.jpg		– Lower Plate, Top Side with tag  
    PAL01_2012_5319_L_T.jpg			  – Lower Plate, Top Side  
    PAL01_2012_5319_L_B_ID.jpg		– Lower Plate, Bottom Side with tag   
    PAL01_2012_5319_L_B.jpg			  – Lower Plate, Bottom Side  

10.	After photographing all units, if the CAUs were submerged in seawater, carefully rinse each plate in freshwater. If the CAUs were submerged in freshwater, skip the rinsing process.

11.	Be sure to remove all hex nuts and washers that may still be attached at the center of the plate. Hex nuts and washers can be covered by calcified material and difficult to see. Inspect each side of each plate to ensure that there are no washers or hex nuts present. If a hex nut or washer is covered in calcified material, remove the hardware and chip off the calcified material from the hardware. Retain the removed material with the rest of the plate.

12.	Place each plate and any dislodged pieces of calcified material on its corresponding Paper Tray A, then onto a drying rack and placed in the fume hood. The drying rack can be left in a fume hood to air dry at room temperature indefinitely (**minimum of 24 hours**), until they are dried in the oven.  

** *Drying at room temperature before placing in the oven can help reduce the time the plates remain in the oven.*  

** *Wash and rinse the glass dishes but keep the labels on. The same glass dishes will be used during the HCl acid decalcification process.*


#### Determining the weight of the CAU plate

1.	After a minimum air-drying period of 24 hours, place the **plate assembly (plate, dislodged pieces of calcified material and Paper Tray A)** in the oven labeled “**Non-HCl**” to dry at 60°C for 24 hours.  

    ** *Check that the internal temperature remains consistent. If not, minor adjustments should be made to the oven temperature and damper settings.*

2.	After 24 hours, remove the plate assembly and allow it to come to room temperature (roughly 10 min).

3.	Weigh the **entire plate assembly**.

4.	In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App (or CAU Data Entry tool for ESD-CREP users), record the weight to at least 3 decimal places under the column ‘*Drying 1 [24 h] [paper tray + CAU plate] [g]*’. 

5.	Return the plate assembly in the oven.

6.	Dry the CAU plates for another 24 hours.

7.	Remove the plate assembly and allow it to come to room temperature (roughly 10 min).

8.	Weigh the **entire plate assembly**.

9.	In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App (or CAU Data Entry tool for ESD-CREP users), record the 2nd weight to at least 3 decimal places under the column ‘*Drying 2 [48 h] [paper tray + CAU plate] [g]*’.

10.	Compare the current weight from the previous weight:  

    a. If the difference in weight is less than 0.1g, the plates are considered dry and no further drying needs to occur. This is automatically calculated by the ESD Apex CAU Mission App and denoted by the ‘Plate Dry’ column on the far right saying ‘YES’.
		
    b. If the difference in weight is greater than 0.1 g, return the plates to the oven for another 24 hours.

11.	Repeat *III.B Steps 5-10* until the difference in weight is less than 0.1 g.


#### Decalcification of CaCO3 in Hydrochloric Acid 

**Be sure to wear proper PPE when handling acid contaminated objects (steps 1-9) including gloves, safety glasses, and lab coat.**

1.	Ensure that the plate is fully dry (mass lost between last two weighing will have been less than 0.1g) and the weight of the plate assembly and Paper Tray A has been recorded.

2.	Place the individual plates in the pre-labeled glass dishes. Keep Paper Tray A and place under the glass dish.
 
3.	Chip off large pieces of calcified materials (e.g. CCA, coral, shells, etc.) and grind using a mortar and pestle. Return the pulverized forms in the glass dish.

4.	Fill the glass dish midway with 5% HCl (or otherwise chosen concentration) acid solution  or until the entire CAU plate is fully submerged in acid. **Add HCl acid slowly as the solution may overflow when bubble formation/decalcification begins. The overflow most definitely occurs when dissolving plates from Rose and Swains Atoll.**

5.	When decalcification has slowed (12-24 hours):  

    a.	Scrape leftover material from the CAU plates with a razor blade into the glass dish. (See III.C, Step 8-15).  

    b. Grind pieces of calcified materials that may still be present and return in the glass dish.  

    c. Using acid-resistant gloves, sort through the scraped fleshy material in the glass dish and feel for any calcified materials.  

    d. Some calcified material can be completely covered by a boundary layer of fleshy material. If present, manually tease the fleshy material and grind the calcified material to allow decalcification to continue.  

    e. If there are more calcified materials in the dish, but no obvious decalcification occurring (no bubble formation), decant the used acid solution and drain the fleshy material into another pre-labeled containers (beakers, glass dish, etc). Add new 5% HCl acid solution (*or desired concentration) in the first glass dish to continue dissolving the remaining calcified materials.   

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CAU_dissolve.jpg"))`

6.	Repeat III.C, Steps 5b)-e) until all CaCO3 is fully dissolved. Additional 5% HCl acid solution (*or desired concentration) may need to be added 2-4x, depending on the amount of CaCO3 present.

7.	Using 5% HCl acid (*or desired concentration) in a squeeze bottle, thoroughly rinse the tools (gloves, mortar and pestle, razor/scraper) into the glass dish. 

8.	When the CAU PVC plates have been scraped clean (fleshy/calcified material completely removed from either side and edges of the plate), rinse all sides of the plates with 5% acid (*or desired concentration) into the glass dish.

9.	Have a bowl of freshwater ready to scrub and rinse the CAU PVC plates once they are completely clear of particles from the previous step. Pat to dry.

10.	Place the CAU PVC plate on its corresponding Paper Tray A.

11.	Place the rinsed CAU PVC plates in the oven at 60°C for 24 hours on top of the corresponding Paper Tray A.

12.	Remove the plate from the oven and allow to come to room temperature (roughly 10 min). 

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CAU_drying.jpg"))`

13.	Weigh the clean and dry CAU PVC plate without the underlying paper tray. - *Paper Tray A can be discarded after the CAU PVC plates have been weighed and recorded.

14.	In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App, record the weight to at least 3 decimal places under the column ‘*CAU PVC Dry Weight [g]*’.

15.	Collect the clean and weighed CAU PVCs and store for redeployment/archiving.


#### Vacuum filtration of fleshy material

**Be sure to wear proper PPE when handling acid contaminated objects (steps 1-4) including gloves, safety glasses, and lab coat.**

1.	Using a 4-liter Buchner funnel, a plastic mesh layer (with attached pull string) and the corresponding pre-weighed filter paper, vacuum filter the acid bath and remaining fleshy material for each CAU plate. Use a freshwater squeeze bottle to rinse contents of the glass dish into the funnel.

2.	If the volume of fleshy material is sufficient to clog the filter paper, a 2nd pre-labeled and pre-weighed filter paper (*see III.D, Step 2, a-c*) can be used to filter the remaining volume of acid bath and fleshy material:  

    a. Label an additional filter paper and paper tray with its corresponding CAU Plate ID (e.g. *PAL01_2012_5319_U*).  

    b. In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App, record the weight of the 2nd filter paper + paper tray to at least 3 decimal places in the column '*Addtl Filter & Paper tray B Dry Weight [g]*’.  

3.	If filtering has slowed down, use a spatula/teaspoon to gently scrape the surface of the filter paper to allow more solution to filter through. Filtering can take >5 mins depending the amount of fleshy material in the acid bath.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CAU_filter.jpg"))`

4.	When filtration is completed, place the filter paper on its corresponding Paper Tray B and onto a drying rack. The drying rack should be left in a fume hood to air dry at room temperature (minimum of 24 hours). The filter paper can continue to air dry at room temperature, indefinitely, until they are dried in the oven.


#### Determining the weight of the fleshy material

**Be sure to wear proper PPE (gloves) when handling acid contaminated filters in this section.**

1.	After a minimum air-drying period of 24 hours, place the **filter paper assembly (filter paper and Paper Tray B)** in the oven to dry at 60°C for 24 hours.  

** *Check that the internal temperature remains consistent. If not, minor adjustments should be made to the oven temperature and damper settings.*

2.	After 24 hours, remove the filterpaper assembly and allow it to come to room temperature (roughly 10min).

3.	Weigh the *entire filterpaper assembly.*

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/CAU_weigh.jpg"))`

4.	In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App, record the weight to at least 3 decimal places under “Filters” >‘*Drying 1 [24 h] [paper tray + filterpaper] [g]*’. 

5.	Return the filterpaper assembly to the oven.

6.	Dry the filterpaper for another 24 hours.

7.	Remove the filterpaper assembly and allow it to come to room temperature (roughly 10min).

8.	Weigh the **entire filterpaper assembly**

9.	In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App, record the weight to at least 3 decimal places under “Filters” >‘*Drying 2 [48 h] [paper tray + filterpaper] [g]*’. 

10.	Compare the current weight from the previous weight:  

    a. If the difference in weight is less than 0.1g, the plates are considered dry and no further drying/weighing needs to occur.     
    b. If the difference in weight is greater than 0.1 g, return the plates to the oven for another 24 hours.  

** *In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App, the column to the far right called “Filter Dry” has been formatted to change from ‘NO’ to “YES” if the difference in weight is less than 0.1g.*   

11.	Repeat III.E Steps 5-10 until the difference in weight is less than 0.1 g.

12.	After recording the final filterpaper assembly dry weight, place the filterpaper and Paper tray B in its corresponding re-sealable bag for archiving. Ensure the bag is labeled properly using the CAU Plate ID naming convention:  

*SiteID_RecoveryYear_4-digitSerial#_PlateLocation (“U” - upper plate, “L” - lower plate)*

### Application Overview

Summary: This web application was created using Oracle Application Express (APEX) 5.0 in order facilitate the process of recording the Calcification Accretion Unit (CAU) weights into a database. In order to request access to the application, please contact ITS or the Data Management department for assistance.  
	 
Interface: The web application is categorized in to four main sections:  

* **Home**
* **Data Entry**
* **Data Summary**
* **Audit**
	 

#### Home
	 
This page breaks down the number of CAUs that still need to be weighed by Plate, Site, and Island. The 
**Valid Plate**, **Valid Filter**, and **Filter Subplate** fields are explained in another section.
	 
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data1.jpg"))`

#### Data Entry 
	 
The Data Entry section is where you will go to enter all the weights that you will find. This table shows all the data that has been entered. Editing the plate weights and filter weights are actually recorded in separate pages by clicking on items 6 and 7. Below is an image of what you’ll see when you navigate to the Data Entry page.
	 
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data2.jpg"))`  

    a.	**Breadcrumb Bar** – use this to navigate through the different levels of the application  

    b.	**Finder Drop Down** – use this to select the column you wish to search by  
    
    c.	**Search Field** – enter search criteria here  

    d.	**Search Button** – click this button to execute your search criteria or hit ‘Enter’  

    e.	**Row Selecto**r – choose the number of rows you wish to display on the page  

    f.	**Action** – Allows you to download the table, and perform more advanced functions  

    g.	**Edit Plate Weights** – Navigates to a new page where data for the CAU plates are entered  

    h.	**Edit Filter Weights** – Navigates to a new page where data for the CAU filters are entered  




**Edit Plate Weights Page**
	 
The **Edit Plate** and **Edit Filter** pages are identical; however, we are going to work with the **Edit Plate** page below. Click on the **Edit Plate Weights** button (shown in figure 2) to navigate to the screen below:
	 
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data3.jpg"))`  

    a.	Filter By Island – Drop down list of islands shown in table  

    b.	Rows to Display – Select number of rows to display  

    c.	Select drying cycle  

        Select the name of the column you wish to edit. Each item in the drop down menu corresponds to a column in the table. Once you’ve selected the cycle, click Apply Filters to begin inputting data into that column  

    d.	Note how only one column can be edited at a time. This application was designed to be used with software that inputs data directly from a scale which uses a tab delimiter  

    e.	Apply Filters – must be clicked each time a change is made on items 1 through 3  

    f.	Edit Filter Weights - Navigates to a new page where CAU filter weight data is inputted  
    
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data4.jpg"))`  
    
    g.	Save – allows you to submit your changes and displays the number of records that have been updated  

    h.	Calculate – Filters any records that have been completed from the table. Once filtered, these CAU plates will be used in the calcification rates calculations. The following criteria must be met before a record is filtered from the Edit Plate Weights and Edit Filter Weights pages:

*	Edit Plate Weights  
+	The **Plate_Dry** column says **YES** (This value determines whether a plate is dry)  
+	The **Paper_Tray_Weight** is NOT empty (Entering ‘0’ will suffice)  
+	The **CAU_Pvc_Dry_Weight** is NOT empty (Entering ‘0’ will suffice)  

*	Edit Filter Weights  
+	The **Filter_Dry** column says **YES** (This value determines whether a filter is dry)  
+	The **Filter_Paper_Tray_Dry_Weight** is NOT blank (Entering ‘0’ will suffice)  

If you notice that a record is not being filtered from the table by clicking on the Calculate button, ensure the three criteria mentioned above are being met.

Note: CAU plates will NOT be accounted for in the final calculations until they have been filtered from this page using the Calculate button.

Unlike the **Save** button, this button will not display how many records have been filtered from the screen.  




**Edit Filter Weights Page**
	 
If you click on the **Edit Filter Weights** button (see figure 3), it will take you to a screen identical to the **Edit Plate Weights** page. The difference here is the type of columns it shows and an **Overflow** button.
	 
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data5.jpg"))`  




**Overflow Page Overview**
	 
Clicking on the Overflow button will bring you to a separate page that displays any subplates that have been created whether they have been dried or not. The **Overflow** page is used to add additional filters (subplates) in the event a filter is too small or heavy for the scale. Explaining how to add, edit, and delete a subplate is explained in another user guide.
	 
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data6.jpg"))`




**Plate/Filter Dry Column**
	 
You will see a column called, **Plate Dry** or **Filter Dry** in some tables. This column automatically updates each time you save your changes.
	 
In a nutshell, the column will take the difference between the previous weight and the current weight. If the difference is outside of the range – **1 g to 0.1 g** then the column will say **NO** if the plate is not dry and **YES** if it is dry.
	 
** *Note: There are times when a plate or filter will actually get heavier between drying cycles due to the moisture in the air; however, a plate/filter is considered dry if it gains no more than 0.1 grams.*
	 


**Comments Column**
	 
This column can be modified by selecting the drying cycle to **Comments**. The comments field allows you to record information about a particular record in the database. Once you make your changes, be sure to click the **Save** button.
	 
** *Note: The ‘Edit Plate Weights’ and ‘Edit Filter Weights’ are two tables that separates the table shown in the ‘Data Entry’ screen due to the number of columns it has. However, even though it may seem that each page has its own Comments field, both pages actually shares that field*
	 



**Valid Plate/Filter Codes**
	 
There are three main codes associated with these columns:

*	N = record is not dry  
*	Y = record is dry and will be included in the calculation if both the upper and lower plates are ‘Y’ or ‘F’  
*	F = record was force-dried and will be included in the calculation if the upper and lower plates are ‘Y’ or ‘F’  
*	B = record is considered bad and is not included in the end calculations  

** *Note: In order to modify the valid plate/filter columns, you will need update access to the CAU_ANALYSIS table inside Oracle SQL Developer. As long as these two fields have a value of either ‘Y’ or ‘F’, the record will be included in the end calculations*

	 
	 
#### Data summary
	 
This section allows you to view the calcification rates by unit, site, or island. You can also export the information to either an HTML or CSV file by clicking the Download option shown below. Tools built-in to the interactive reports can be used to filter the data and create tables for graphical analysis.
	 
Each report has the same options to choose from in the **Actions** drop-down menu. If you need more information about what a particular feature does, click on the **Help** option.
	 
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data7.jpg"))`

The Data Summary page is where you will see the following calculations:  

*	Net Weight  
*	Final Material Dry Weight  
*	Final Fleshy Weight  
*	Calcification Rate By Plate    

There are three additional report pages:  
    
*	Calcification Rate By Unit (shows calculation by grouping the upper and lower plates together)  *	Calcification Rate By Site (shows calculation by grouping the sites together)  
*	Calcification Rate By Island (shows calculation by grouping the islands together)  

**Generating Reports with Calcification Rate By Island**
	 
This page displays the calcification rates by island and includes a bar graph to help depict the number values. You can filter the report by **region name, year, and island** as you wish. Once you’ve made your selections, click on the **Generate Report** button to update the graph and table.
	 
** *Note: The table is a graphical depiction of what is shown in the table below and vice versa*

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data9.jpg"))`



#### Audit

This page is a read-only summary of what is shown in the **Data Entry Summary** page with a few additional columns.

For each column that can be edited by a user, there are two additional columns that correspond to it: **Last Mod By** (shows who last modified column) and **Last Mod DTM** (date, time, month, a record was modified).

For example, in the figure shown below, you see the **Paper Tray Weight** column next to two other fields before the **Filter Paper Tray Dry Weight** is shown.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data10.jpg"))`



### Data Entry Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will be adding plate weights into our application. A similar process would apply to the filter weights.

1.	Click on the Data Entry icon

2.	Next, click on the **Edit Plate Weights** button

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data11.jpg"))`

3.	Let’s say we wish to record the first drying cycle weight for a plate in Baker: and show 25 results per page:

    a.	**Filter By Island** – Select Baker
    b.	**Rows to Display** – Select 25
    c.	**Select Drying Cycle** – Weight Plate Drying 1  

4.	Once you have made your changes, click on the **Apply Filters** button to see them take effect

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data12.jpg"))`

5.	Click inside the text box to input the new weight using the button on the scale. You should automatically see the weight get entered into the cell and the cursor will jump down to the next record. Repeat until you’ve entered all weights for the first drying cycle. Make sure to hit **Save** once you are done and change the drying cycle to **Weight Plate Drying 2** to begin the next cycle when ready.

6.	After you click on **Save**, a green dialog box will tell you how many rows have been updated with new values as shown in the next figure.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data13.jpg"))`

7.	Once you see a record in the **Plate/Filter Dry** column display **YES** in red, this means the plate/filter is dry.

** *Note: The ‘Calculate’ button will not filter a record until a value is entered into the ‘Paper Tray Weight’ and ‘CAU PVC Dry Weight’ fields.*

Once BOTH the upper and lower plates of a CAU unit have been dried and removed from this table, the unit will get calculated into the final calcification rates which can be seen in the **Data Summary** section. If a lower or upper plate in a CAU unit is missing, then the entire CAU unit will NOT be included in the end calculations.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data14.jpg"))`

8.	You can move freely between entering weights for the filters and plates by clicking on the button shown below:

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data15.jpg"))`



### Filter Overflow Tutorial

Summary: There will be times when an additional filter is needed in the event a single filter is not large enough to contain the accumulated calcification. In this case, another plate record or “subplate” must be created in order to keep track of the drying cycle weights for each filter.

*	The Overflow page can only be reached from the Edit Filter Weights page. Therefore, navigate to Data Entry > Edit Filter Weights > Overflow:

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data16.jpg"))`

** *Note: If you’re currently entering data in the Edit Filter Weights page, ensure you save your changes before clicking on the Overflow button.*

*	The **Overflow** page will only allow you to view and add subplates, not edit them. In order to add a subplate, choose the **Island**, **Site**, and **Cau Serial Plate ID**, you wish to add from the drop down arrow shown below.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data17.jpg"))`

* The **Cau Serial Plate ID** drop-down menu will only appear once you have selected a **Site**. You can click the **Reset Filters** button to clear your current selections anytime.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data18.jpg"))`

*	Once you have selected a **Cau Serial Plate ID**, the **Add Subplate** button will appear. Once you’re satisfied with your selection, click the **Add Subplate** button to add the plate into the database

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data19.jpg"))`

** *NOTE: The Cau Serial Plate ID drop-down list will only show non-dry filters currently in the application.*

* You will see your new subplate in the table shown below. To edit the subplate, navigate back to the **Edit Filter Weights** page from the breadcrumb bar at the top of the page.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data20.jpg"))`

*	Notice how there are now two of the same **Cau Serial Plate IDs** in the **Edit Filter Weight**s page. The way to distinguish them is by the **CAU Analysis ID**; this will always be unique. Once created, the subplate is just like any other plate. Add the weight of the additional filter to the **Filter Paper Tray Dry Weight** column.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data21.jpg"))`

**Deleting a Subplate**

Navigate back to the **Overflow** page. If you added a subplate by mistake, click on the pencil icon next to the record you wish to delete in the **Overflow** page.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data22.jpg"))`

** *Note: The original plate will always have a lower CAU Analysis ID than its subplates.*

A window will appear that allows you to view the information before you delete it. If you’re certain you want to remove the record, click the **Delete** button. If not, click **Cancel** or exit out of the window.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data23.jpg"))`

A window prompt should appear asking if you’re certain of your decision. Click **Ok**.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data24.jpg"))`

If successful, you should see a green dialog box appear in the top-right corner.

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Data25.jpg"))`
