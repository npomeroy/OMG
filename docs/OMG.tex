Welcome to the online knowledge base of the OCC Team. This started as the OCC Mission Guide, a reference manual to help consolidate best practices for conducting OCC team operations at sea. As of 2020, it has evolved into an online living book, written in R Markdown and compiled into book with \href{https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/}{bookdown},published via \href{https://pages.github.com/}{GitHub Pages}. The current live version of the book that you can bookmark is \href{https://npomeroy.github.io/OMG/}{here}. All OCC team members are encouraged to not only use it as a resource but help it grow by adding and editing content as OCC projects, methods and missions continue to change and grow. Anyone may suggest edits to the contents of the OMG by forking the OMG repository from \href{https://github.com/npomeroy/OMG}{Noah via GitHub}, pushing any changes back to GitHub, after which they may be approved for incorporation into the master copy of the OMG.

Once you have forked the repo onto your local machine, the HTML version of the OMG may be accessed offline by simply opening the index.html file in the folder ``OMG/docs'' A .PDF file of the book is also generated every time the book is built, that also ends up in the ``OMG/docs'' folder.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Fork the repo from \href{https://github.com/npomeroy/OMG}{Noah via GitHub}.
\item
  Edit any existing chapter by simply editing its .Rmd file in R studio or create a new chapter by creating a new .Rmd file in the root OMG folder. Build the book to see your edits in the form of the built book.
\item
  Commit your changes via GitHub Desktop (or via R if you have setup GitHub to play nicely with R.)
\item
  In GitHub, open a Pull Request to have your edits considered for integration into the master branch.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{The Best How to Guide for Authoring Books with R Markdown} is written by Yihui Xie and is found right \href{https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/}{here}

If you need some tips for your R Markdown formatting, \href{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.html}{this cheat sheet is great.}

If available hands on deck and conditions allow, please conduct the CTD downcast and the water sample collection simultaneously.

\item
  Ensure that the CTD line is connected to the top of the CTD frame by 1 shackles.
\item
  Tie non-CTD end of the CTD line to the boat with a bowline or clip off with carabiner.
\item
  Flake CTD line on deck.
\item
  When the coxswain says the CTD can go over the side, raise the CTD switch to the ``ON'' position, and loudly say, ``ON!'' then lower it over the side until the top of the frame is 1 meter below the surface of the water to begin the 1 minute soaking period, either holding the line or cleating off the line to maintain the CTD at soaking depth.
\item
  After 1 minute soak, ask the coxswain for the current depth so you know how far you can lower the CTD without it hitting the bottom (5-10 feet less line than the bottom depth). Un-cleat the CTD line if it was cleated and begin the CTD cast by pulling the CTD frame up until the top ring of the frame emerges from the water, then begin gradually lowering at a consistent rate, hand over hand, until the CTD gets to the target depth (using the markings on the line to estimate depth). Once the target depth is reached, pull the CTD back on board.
\item
  Once the CTD is back on board, lower the switch to ``OFF'', and loudly say ``OFF!''
\end{enumerate}

  Prime the Niskin Bottle, ensuring the petcock and the air bleed valve are closed.
\item
  Clip off the boat side of the niskin line to the boat.
\item
  Near the end of the the CTD soaking time, lower the weight and the open Niskin bottle over the side so the top of the Niskin is at 1m depth (surface of water at the BLACK mark drawn on Niskin line).
\item
  Clip the messenger on to the line
\item
  When the CTD begins its downcast, send the messenger to trigger the Niskin to close. Ensure no air bubbles are trapped inside the Niskin and bottle sits vertically in the water column before firing the messenger.

The mercuric chloride handler is also required to where disposable nitrile gloves. In the event of contact with any part of the body, wash the area profusely. If contact is made with eyes, abort operations, rinse continuously with fresh water (or salt if fresh has run out), alert the ship and return ASAP.
\item
  Remove a bottle and its stopper from the storage tote and insert the tygon tubing to the bottom of the bottle. With the tygon tubing attached to the Niskin bottle dispensing nipple, open the Niskin bottle valve and allow for three complete flushings of the bottle to occur before stopping the sample collection (i.e.~start the collection and count how long it takes for the bottle to overflow and then allow that to occur for 2x the required fill time\ldots ie. if the bottle fills in 20 seconds, allow the sample water flow to flush the bottle for 60 seconds). Attention must be given to how the sample water enters the bottle. Care should be given to ensure that smooth water flow into the bottle is maintained and that no bubbles are created during the dispensing of sample. Any bubbles introduced to the sample will alter the pCO2 within the sample water and produce inaccurate DIC results.
\item
  After the appropriate flushing time, shut off the Niskin valve to stop the water flow, while at the same time ensuring the tygon tubing doesn't come off the bottom of the sample bottle. Once the flow is shut off, pinch the tubing and in one motion remove it from the bottle. This ``pinch and remove'' action with the tubing should establish a consistent head-space in all the sample bottles. The meniscus of the sample should be about 1 cm below the neck of the bottle (see picture.)
\end{enumerate}

a. Once the proper head space is established, pipette 200ul of HgCl2 saturated solution into the sample bottle
b. Use the syringe containing vacuum grease to make 3-5 vertical ``stripes'' of grease on a clean, dry stopper. Insert the greased stopper until fully seated in the bottle, then twist until the grease completely seals the bottle contents. The vertical stripes of grease allow for gases to escape the bottle neck while the stopper is being inserted. Having the stopper clean/dry ensures that other than sample water isn't introduced into the bottle. Twisting the stopper, once it has been fully seated into the neck of the bottle, ensures a smooth distribution of grease within the sample bottle's neck and an air tight seal.
c.~Use the rubber band and plastic collar to lock down the stopper inside the bottle. Once secured, softly invert the bottle 1-2x to mix the HgCl2 with the water sampleand secure the sample bottle in the field container.
d.~Complete data sheet including REA Site name or OCC Site Name (if it exists), waypoint name (default), UTC date and time, lat and long, sample depth and DIC bottle \#.

\textbf{Factory Recalibration of the Solo 3}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Call RBR to arrange the re-calibration of each Solo 3, which will cost approx. \$120
\item
  Instrument drift over 3 years should be less than .006 C, thus there is no need to re-calibrate the data set with post-cruise calibration coefficients
\item
  In Ruskin, by default, the name of a data file is composed of the following information:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The first six digits represent the logger serial number.
  \item
    The next eight digits represent the current year, month, and day.
  \item
    The next four digits represent the current time to the minute.
  \item
    The file extension indicates the file format and should not be changed. If you change it, the file extension that you specify becomes part of the name, and the required extension is appended. For example, the file named 911936\_20090522\_1613.rsk contains data for a logger with a serial number of 911936 whose data was downloaded in 2009 on May 22 at 4:13 pm.

\hypertarget{sbe56}{%
\section{Seabird Electronics SBE56 STR}\label{sbe56}}

As of 2020, the OCC team is not buying anymore SBE56 sensors due to history of inadequate endurance we've experienced with them. We have determined that units within a certain range of serial number are high risk for low endurance (Ari knows the bad ones!)

Just like the RBR Solo v3, the SBE56 is programmed to sample every 5 minutes for 30S. The user mnual for the SBE56 can be found \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ujFmH1pJ704ikrsc11Ji2eNeuIBQ5JMa}{here}.

\textbf{Here are the basic steps to program the SBE56:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Open SeatermV2 and select SBE56 from the instruments menu.
  \includegraphics{images/SBE56_program_step_1.jpg}
\item
  Open the housing with the custom endcap remover and connect the SBE 56 to your PC via a USB mini cable.
  \includegraphics{images/SBE56_connect.jpg}
\item
  When a successful connection is made, you will notice a ``Device Identified'' notification in the bottom left of the screen and you will see the serial number of the unit you have connected to in the upper left of the application window and in the current configuration window.
  \includegraphics{images/SBE56_program_step_2.jpg}
\item
  Edit the configuration options as follows
\item
  sample period = 5 minutes (300 seconds)
\item
  set time to UTC by clicking the ``time options'' button on the right and select ``GreenWich Mean Time.''
  \includegraphics{images/SBE56_program_step_3.jpg}
\item
  check the box for clear memory
\item
  check the boxy for clear events
\item
  check the box for new battery installed (if it is relatively new, which if it is just back from refurbishment, it should be)
\item
  set the date and time for the unit to begin sampling for a time is prior to the day it will be deployed
\item
  When you are done editing the configuration of the SBE56, click the ``Update Configuration'' button and confirm the changes you want to make when the pop-up window asks you to do so. When you have finished, you should see the notification in the bottom left that says, ``finished configuring device - success.'' At this point double check that the ``current configuration'' window on the left shows the parameters that you intended to program the instrument with.
  \includegraphics{images/SBE56_program_step_4.jpg}
\item
  At this point, you can disconnect the SBE56, install a new dessicant in its endcap, examine its o-rings for any hairs and re-seal the housing. It is now ready for taping and installation in the deployment bracket.

\section{Conditioning the SeaFet in seawater at least 24 hours prior to deployment}\label{conditioning-the-seafet-in-seawater-at-least-24-hours-prior-to-deployment}}

At least 24 hours prior to deployment, the SeaFet must be activated in polled mode (aka low power, aka sleep mode) in a large volume of solution with a similar pH to the pH of the waters in which the unit will be deployed in order to produce accurate data immediately upon deployment. We call this ``conditioning time''. Conditioning in the wetcap with artificial seawater will not work because ionic exchange will quickly change the pH of the small volume of water in the wetcap, thus not actually conditioning the instrument.

\section{Properly Store the SeaFet}\label{properly-store-the-seafet}}

It is crucial to store the SeaFET sensors with clean seawater in the wet cap. If seawater is not available, artificial seawater will suffice. The internal KCl reference gel in the DuraFET will become dry if left out of water, resulting in calibration drift and potentially causing irreversible damage. \textbf{Do not store} the SeaFET with freshwater in the wet cap, as this will change the chemistry of the external reference electrode.

If storing or shipping the SeaFET, disconnect the batteries in SeaFETCOM:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Connect the SeaFET to SeaFETCom
\item
  Navigate to Sensor \&gt; Advanced \&gt; Disconnect for Storage.
\end{itemize}

This will disconnect the isolated battery pack from the external reference sensor to retain battery life.

\textbf{Notes on SeaFet soaking and response time}

February 12, 2018 Hi Noah,

\textbf{Yes indeed, if you are concerned about the time it takes to stabilize, you could combat this by immersing in some seawater that is close to the sites parameters ahead of time.}

\textbf{Know however, that having the SeaFET running in the small volume of water within the wetcap, it will quickly become altered from normal regarding the small volume and ionic exchange.}

\textbf{(This might be the reason why you mentioned the pH value of 6 in the wetcap currently.)}

\textbf{Ideally one would want to have a larger water} volume however this might require some creativity to accomplish !

Proposed settings look fine !

Regarding a specific start time:

Within SeaFETCom - SeaFET Settings - In the SeaFET General Settings Tab you can select the desired Start date, but I not Believe you can specify the time of day.

But looking into the firmware commands it appears the SeaFET can be programmed with a start time as well.

At the SeaFET's command prompt, enter the following commands as an example: ``set --samplwin true'' and then "set --samstart yyyy/mm/dd.hh:mm:ss

Note these commands can be sent using the ``Command Terminal'' found under Sensor Menu - Advanced in SeaFETCom, or through TeraTerm direct serial connection.

I believe programming in periodic mode, with a delayed start up time would achieve the same effect.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Kind Regards,
Darrell

Hello Noah,

Thank You for your email !

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is 24hrs adequate for the instrument to ``warm up'' in polled mode (I believe you've called this ``conditioning mode'' before) prior to deployment or are multiple days necessary?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The time of }** SeaFET ****'s sensors adjusting to the in-situ environment can vary. Really it depends on how different the water is from the storage solution.
When we perform calibration it can take anywhere for a day, to several days - but we are looking for high level of stability.
When deploying the **** SeaFET **** the pH values may take a couple of days for the readings to stabilize to the environment.**

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How long can the sensor be exposed to air before damage to the sensor occurs? (We are wondering about best practices for taking the instrument from the small boat into the water. For instance, the wetcap remains on the instrument until we get to the dive site. We get to the dive site and prepare our SCUB gear, then remove the wetcap and affix the protective copper endcap over the sensor - at this point, 1 to several minutes my pass before it is actually submerged in the ocean when we roll in the water.)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{I do not see a problem here. For damage to occur to the ISFET it will have to become dry. I would say best practice would be no more than 1 hour. But a couple of hours will not cause damage, just likely additional time to reach stability in the new environment. The external reference can become dry without damage - but some further conditioning time would be expected.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is setting the instrument to periodic mode with a future sample start date considered a low power mode, comparable to ``polled mode''
\end{itemize}

Yes I believe this would achieve the same, however you would need to ensure to switch to polled mode if this is method use during deployment.
If you have an external controller, polled is likely the better option for use. If you were using periodic mode and an external device collecting the SeaFET's data - this would rely on the two systems have no change in the their clocks. Polled mode would be better as the external controller would be able to collect data whenever it chooses.

I hope this helps !

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Kind Regards,
Darrell

Hi Noah,

You've brought up some good questions about the SeaFET- I went ahead and consulted our engineer responsible for this instrument to obtain some more concrete answers.

SeaFET soak time:

Craig is correct- the SeaFET requires a ``conditioning time'' that allows the sensors to stabilize before achieving full accuracy. I've attached a paper that explores the best practices for obtaining quality data from the SeaFET. Please reference this document for quality control procedures. From this paper:

Upon first contact with seawater, pH sensor voltages relative to both reference electrodes exhibit an asymptotic
drift. This conditioning period arises from several sources:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Achieving a stable flow of ions across the liquid junction of the internal reference electrode (nominally hours),
\item
  replacement of Cl -- with Br ? in the solid solution of AgCl of the Cl-ISE (nominally days),
\item
  an ISFET conditioning component, related to the initial power-up of the chip, the exact basis of which is not fully understood (nominally 1 day), and
\item
  a pressure effect on the ISFET and internal reference electrode through changes in the liquid junction potential that may become important if the sensor is deployed more than 20 m below the surface (nominally 1 h).
\end{enumerate}

Factors 1--3 can be addressed by operating the pH sensor continuously in seawater (never powering off the ISFET) for one week prior to deployment and taking care to keep the sensor wetted in natural seawater during transport.

SeaFET response time:

It very much depends on the system at hand. After initial conditioning (as described above):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi})}
\item
  With continuous water flow, either naturally occurring or forced, the response is practically instantaneous.
\item
  If the sensor has to re-condition to a new volume of water for every measurement, it could take up to 30sec to converge to the right number. For the SeapHox we added a configuration parameter to delay the measurement for this reason.
\end{enumerate}

These reasons certainly make the SeaFET a poor match for use on a moving platform. I hope this clarifies your questions about the SeaFET. Please review the attached paper and let us know if you have additional questions.

Regards,

Greg

  9/14/15 email: The new boards have a voltage regulator that can be set to 11.0 volts if only one pump is used and to 13.0 volts if two pumps are used (this gives the motor more torque needed to drive two pumps).

Temperature: 70°C (140°F)  
Damper: level 3 (mid-high)  
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Prepare 5\% HCl acid solution in 2-liter bottles}

One batch (20-30 units) of CAUs will require about 10-15, 2-liter bottles of 5\% HCl acid solution in order to completely dissolve calcified materials. More may be needed depending on the amount of accreted CaCO3.

To dilute full-strength HCl acid (1.18 g/mL, 36.5 molar mass, 37\% conc.) into 5\% solution, use the recommended ratio below:

\begin{verbatim}
2L stock: 225 ml HCl  
     1775 ml deionized/distilled H2O  

1L stock: 112.5 ml HCl  
     887.5 ml deionized/distilled H2O  
\end{verbatim}

** Be sure to \textbf{ADD ACID TO WATER} to avoid excessive heating, violent boiling or splashing of concentrated acid that could result from the exothermic reaction.
``Do as you oughta, add acid to water!'' - Dr.~Anne Cohen, WHOI

** Acid solutions with a higher (\textgreater5\% HCl concentration) may be prepared and used if desired for processing CAUs from heavily calcified regions (American Samoa, PRIAs), however concentrations \textbf{greater than or equal to 15\% HCl require special PPE including fume hood utilization.}

\item
  From the designated CAU photoset folder, confirm that both plate photos (with and without the Plate Photo ID tag) are in focus. After photographing both sides of each plate, each CAU photoset folder should have \textbf{8 photos}. The photos should be later on renamed with the following naming convention:

  \textbf{a) With Plate Photo ID tag:}\\
  *SiteID\_RecoveryYear\_4-digitSerial\#\_PlateLocation (``U'' - upper plate or ``L'' - lower plate)\_PlateSurface (``T'' - top plate or ``B'' - bottom plate)\_ID.jpg*

  \textbf{b) Without Plate Photo ID tag:}\\
  *SiteID\_RecoveryYear\_4-digitSerial\#\_PlateLocation (``U'' - upper plate, ``L'' lower plate)\_PlateSurface (``T'' - top plate, ``B'' - bottom plate).jpg*

  Example:
  PAL01\_2012\_5319\_U\_T\_ID.jpg -- Upper Plate, Top Side with tag\\
  PAL01\_2012\_5319\_U\_T.jpg -- Upper Plate, Top Side\\
  PAL01\_2012\_5319\_U\_B\_ID.jpg -- Upper Plate, Bottom Side with tag
  PAL01\_2012\_5319\_U\_B.jpg -- Upper Plate, Bottom Side\\
  PAL01\_2012\_5319\_L\_T\_ID.jpg -- Lower Plate, Top Side with tag\\
  PAL01\_2012\_5319\_L\_T.jpg -- Lower Plate, Top Side\\
  PAL01\_2012\_5319\_L\_B\_ID.jpg -- Lower Plate, Bottom Side with tag\\
  PAL01\_2012\_5319\_L\_B.jpg -- Lower Plate, Bottom Side
\item
  After photographing all units, if the CAUs were submerged in seawater, carefully rinse each plate in freshwater. If the CAUs were submerged in freshwater, skip the rinsing process.
\item
  Be sure to remove all hex nuts and washers that may still be attached at the center of the plate. Hex nuts and washers can be covered by calcified material and difficult to see. Inspect each side of each plate to ensure that there are no washers or hex nuts present. If a hex nut or washer is covered in calcified material, remove the hardware and chip off the calcified material from the hardware. Retain the removed material with the rest of the plate.
\item
  Place each plate and any dislodged pieces of calcified material on its corresponding Paper Tray A, then onto a drying rack and placed in the fume hood. The drying rack can be left in a fume hood to air dry at room temperature indefinitely (\textbf{minimum of 24 hours}), until they are dried in the oven.
\end{enumerate}

Drying at room temperature before placing in the oven can help reduce the time the plates remain in the oven.

Wash and rinse the glass dishes but keep the labels on. The same glass dishes will be used during the HCl acid decalcification process.

  Grind pieces of calcified materials that may still be present and return in the glass dish.
\item
  Using acid-resistant gloves, sort through the scraped fleshy material in the glass dish and feel for any calcified materials.
\item
  Some calcified material can be completely covered by a boundary layer of fleshy material. If present, manually tease the fleshy material and grind the calcified material to allow decalcification to continue.
\item
  If there are more calcified materials in the dish, but no obvious decalcification occurring (no bubble formation), decant the used acid solution and drain the fleshy material into another pre-labeled containers (beakers, glass dish, etc).
