All STRs must be programmed prior to deployment and have fresh batteries and dessicant installed. See manual’s for specific programming guidance. 5.1 RBR Solo V3 STR Find the user manual in “Reference” section of OCC files at sea or at this google drive link Physical Preparation for Deployment Use brand new Tadiran Lithium Thionyl Chloride 3.6v batteries Wrap instrument housing with yellow “PVC floor marking tape”, leaving the serial number exposed Programming Open Ruskin Connect to the instrument with the supplies USB C cable, it should appear in the “Navigator” view after a few seconds Ensure that your computer is connected to the internet so that the program can get the correct time from your computer. Click UTC to set the instrument’s time to UTC Click on the “Information” tab and confirm that the battery has 3.6v After programming each instrument, disconnect the USB cable, install a fresh desiccant and close the instrument in a short period of time so that the desiccant does not absorb ambient moisture in the air Parameters Sampling Interval: 1 sample every 5 minutes Sampling mode: Continuous “Ruskin_instrument.log” keeps a text file that includes the parameters of each instrument programmed .rsk files are sqlight data files which are open source and non-proprietary Downloading Data from Solo 3 Connect to the instrument Select the dataset and download it Processing RBR Solo 3 Data Files see Data Processing with the OCC Package Factory Recalibration of the Solo 3 Call RBR to arrange the re-calibration of each Solo 3, which will cost approx. $120 Instrument drift over 3 years should be less than .006 C, thus there is no need to re-calibrate the data set with post-cruise calibration coefficients In Ruskin, by default, the name of a data file is composed of the following information: The first six digits represent the logger serial number. The next eight digits represent the current year, month, and day. The next four digits represent the current time to the minute. The file extension indicates the file format and should not be changed. If you change it, the file extension that you specify becomes part of the name, and the required extension is appended. For example, the file named 911936_20090522_1613.rsk contains data for a logger with a serial number of 911936 whose data was downloaded in 2009 on May 22 at 4:13 pm. 5.2 Seabird Electronics SBE56 STR As of 2020, the OCC team is not buying anymore SBE56 sensors due to history of inadequate endurance we’ve experienced with them. We have determined that units within a certain range of serial number are high risk for low endurance (Ari knows the bad ones!) Just like the RBR Solo v3, the SBE56 is programmed to sample every 5 minutes for 30S. The user mnual for the SBE56 can be found here. Here are the basic steps to program the SBE56: Open SeatermV2 and select SBE56 from the instruments menu. Open the housing with the custom endcap remover and connect the SBE 56 to your PC via a USB mini cable. When a successful connection is made, you will notice a “Device Identified” notification in the bottom left of the screen and you will see the serial number of the unit you have connected to in the upper left of the application window and in the current configuration window. Edit the configuration options as follows sample period = 5 minutes (300 seconds) set time to UTC by clicking the “time options” button on the right and select “GreenWich Mean Time.” check the box for clear memory check the boxy for clear events check the box for new battery installed (if it is relatively new, which if it is just back from refurbishment, it should be) set the date and time for the unit to begin sampling for a time is prior to the day it will be deployed When you are done editing the configuration of the SBE56, click the “Update Configuration” button and confirm the changes you want to make when the pop-up window asks you to do so. When you have finished, you should see the notification in the bottom left that says, “finished configuring device - success.” At this point double check that the “current configuration” window on the left shows the parameters that you intended to program the instrument with. At this point, you can disconnect the SBE56, install a new dessicant in its endcap, examine its o-rings for any hairs and re-seal the housing. It is now ready for taping and installation in the deployment bracket.

We call this conditioning time. Conditioning in the wetcap with artificial seawater will not work because ionic exchange will quickly change the pH of the small volume of water in the wetcap, thus not actually conditioning the instrument. ##How to Set the SeaFet to polled mode** If needed, install new batteries in the SeaFet (12 Ds) Remove dummy plug from endcap of SeaFet and connect SeaFet to computer with USB cable Open SeaFetCom software Swipe magnet over magnetic switch to activate batteries (indicator light by magnetic switch will blink green) Press connect Open settings and confirm operational mode is **polled mode* Click upload to make sure Click disconnect 7.2 Programming the SeaFet for Deployment (After it has already been warming up in polled, aka low power sleep mode for at least 24hrs) In the dry lab prior to deployment At least 24 hours prior to deployment: install and activate internal batteries. To activate internal batteries, swipe the magnet to the target until the indicator LED starts flashing green (this may take a few attempts). Alternatively, connect the instrument to the computer and place in periodic mode following instructions below. Remove the dummy plug and connect data logger cable. Open SeaFETCom and select Connect to SeaFET to begin communications with instrument. Sync instrument clock with computer clock: Sensor -&amp;gt; Set Clock, Sync Time . Instrument time should be in UTC. To access SeaFET deployment settings, select the SeaFET Settings button in the dashboard window or Sensor -&amp;gt; SeaFET Settings. Use the following settings: General Operational Mode: Periodic Sample Interval : 1 min Offset : 0 sec Number of samples in average: 30 Number of frames in burst: 1 Enable Sampling Window : If using, check box and set appropriate start and end dates *We haven't been able to make this work well, so don't use sampling interval for now* Internal Device Logging ** Logging level:** INFO Maximum log file size: 9999 KB Telemetry Serial Baud Rate: 57600 Transmitted Frame Format: FULL_ASCII Instrument Logging Frame Format: FULL_ASCII Log File Creation Method : By file size Maximum Size: 9999 KB Unchecklegacy format Processing Salinity : 35 psu External Pump - no external pump in use CTD – no CTD in use Note: For RAMP deployments, the SeaFET will be deployed in periodic mode , in which it will sample at a specified interval and burst size and go to sleep in between measurements. The instrument can be put in polled mode, in which it remains in a low power sleep state until woken by an external command, for long-term storage or shipping. Continuous mode should only be used when the instrument is powered by an external power source. Activiate the instrument prior to getting on the small boat Start deployment by selecting the Start button in the SeaFETCom dashboard or Sensor -&amp;gt; Start. Disconnect from SeaFET, remove data logger cable, and replace dummy plug. On the small boat Immediately prior to deployment, remove wet cap. Remove two stainless steel plugs and store securely. Invert the instrument to pour the storage solution from the wet cap into a sink. Using a 5/32* hex driver or Allen key, remove the three 10-32 x 5/8* socket head cap screws from the wet cap. Remove the wet cap. Install foul guard. Place instrument on a flat surface with the sensor end cap up. Place the electrode foul guard over the electrode. Insert the three 10-32 x 5/8* socket head cap screws removed from wet cap and tighten completely. Sensor end cap should not be exposed to air for more than a few seconds, so submerge in water if not immediately deploying underwater. Retrieving the SeaFet Upon recovery of the instrument, stick the wetcap end into a bucket of seawater for return to the ship or remove foul guard and replace wet cap. Ensure wet cap is filled with sterilized, artificial seawater or filtered seawater. Keep the sensor end wet at all times (it can be without water no more than an hour). 7.3 Downloading Data from the SeaFet** Remove dummy plug, attach data logger cable, and connect to SeaFETCOM software. Select Transfer Files from the SeaFETCom Dashboard. In the Local Filesystem pane, press Browse to select the local folder on the computer that will receive downloaded files. In the Instrument Filesystem pane, select the files to be downloaded from the SeaFET and press the &amp;lt;- button to transfer selected files. A Seafet deployment creates 2 file types: a log file that contains metadata about the deployment and the data file (may be more than one data file) If the instrument will be used in the near future, place in polled mode following deployment steps above. This low-power stand-by mode will maintain a continuous current flow to the sensing element and eliminate the need for a 24-hour warmup. If the instrument will not be used in the near future, deactivate internal batteries by swiping the magnet over the target until the LED flashes red. 7.4 Properly Store the SeaFet It is crucial to store the SeaFET sensors with clean seawater in the wet cap. If seawater is not available, artificial seawater will suffice. The internal KCl reference gel in the DuraFET will become dry if left out of water, resulting in calibration drift and potentially causing irreversible damage. Do not store the SeaFET with freshwater in the wet cap, as this will change the chemistry of the external reference electrode. If storing or shipping the SeaFET, disconnect the batteries in SeaFETCOM: Connect the SeaFET to SeaFETCom Navigate to Sensor &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Disconnect for Storage. This will disconnect the isolated battery pack from the external reference sensor to retain battery life. 7.5 Email Exchanges about Seafet for reference Notes on SeaFet soaking and response time February 12, 2018 Hi Noah, Yes indeed, if you are concerned about the time it takes to stabilize, you could combat this by immersing in some seawater that is close to the sites parameters ahead of time. Know however, that having the SeaFET running in the small volume of water within the wetcap, it will quickly become altered from normal regarding the small volume and ionic exchange. (This might be the reason why you mentioned the pH value of 6 in the wetcap currently.) Ideally one would want to have a larger water volume however this might require some creativity to accomplish ! Proposed settings look fine ! Regarding a specific start time: Within SeaFETCom - SeaFET Settings - In the SeaFET General Settings Tab you can select the desired Start date, but I not Believe you can specify the time of day. But looking into the firmware commands it appears the SeaFET can be programmed with a start time as well. At the SeaFET's command prompt, enter the following commands as an example: set –samplwin true and then *set –samstart yyyy/mm/dd.hh:mm:ss Note these commands can be sent using the Command Terminal found under Sensor Menu - Advanced in SeaFETCom, or through TeraTerm direct serial connection. I believe programming in periodic mode, with a delayed start up time would achieve the same effect. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. Kind Regards, Darrell February 9, 2018 Email from Darrel at Seabird Tech Support: Hello Noah, Thank You for your email ! Is 24hrs adequate for the instrument to warm up in polled mode (I believe you've called this conditioning mode before) prior to deployment or are multiple days necessary? The time of ** SeaFET ****'s sensors adjusting to the in-situ environment can vary. Really it depends on how different the water is from the storage solution. When we perform calibration it can take anywhere for a day, to several days - but we are looking for high level of stability. When deploying the **** SeaFET **** the pH values may take a couple of days for the readings to stabilize to the environment.** How long can the sensor be exposed to air before damage to the sensor occurs? (We are wondering about best practices for taking the instrument from the small boat into the water. For instance, the wetcap remains on the instrument until we get to the dive site. We get to the dive site and prepare our SCUB gear, then remove the wetcap and affix the protective copper endcap over the sensor - at this point, 1 to several minutes my pass before it is actually submerged in the ocean when we roll in the water.) I do not see a problem here. For damage to occur to the ISFET it will have to become dry. I would say best practice would be no more than 1 hour. But a couple of hours will not cause damage, just likely additional time to reach stability in the new environment. The external reference can become dry without damage - but some further conditioning time would be expected. Is setting the instrument to periodic mode with a future sample start date considered a low power mode, comparable to polled mode Yes I believe this would achieve the same, however you would need to ensure to switch to polled mode if this is method use during deployment. If you have an external controller, polled is likely the better option for use. If you were using periodic mode and an external device collecting the SeaFET's data - this would rely on the two systems have no change in the their clocks. Polled mode would be better as the external controller would be able to collect data whenever it chooses. I hope this helps ! Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. Kind Regards, Darrell Greg Ikeda Thu, Oct 1, 2015 at 10:44 AM Hi Noah, You've brought up some good questions about the SeaFET- I went ahead and consulted our engineer responsible for this instrument to obtain some more concrete answers. SeaFET soak time: Craig is correct- the SeaFET requires a conditioning time that allows the sensors to stabilize before achieving full accuracy. I've attached a paper that explores the best practices for obtaining quality data from the SeaFET. Please reference this document for quality control procedures. From this paper: Upon first contact with seawater, pH sensor voltages relative to both reference electrodes exhibit an asymptotic drift. This conditioning period arises from several sources: Achieving a stable flow of ions across the liquid junction of the internal reference electrode (nominally hours), replacement of Cl – with Br ? in the solid solution of AgCl of the Cl-ISE (nominally days), an ISFET conditioning component, related to the initial power-up of the chip, the exact basis of which is not fully understood (nominally 1 day), and a pressure effect on the ISFET and internal reference electrode through changes in the liquid junction potential that may become important if the sensor is deployed more than 20 m below the surface (nominally 1 h). Factors 1–3 can be addressed by operating the pH sensor continuously in seawater (never powering off the ISFET) for one week prior to deployment and taking care to keep the sensor wetted in natural seawater during transport. SeaFET response time: It very much depends on the system at hand. After initial conditioning (as described above): With continuous water flow, either naturally occurring or forced, the response is practically instantaneous. If the sensor has to re-condition to a new volume of water for every measurement, it could take up to 30sec to converge to the right number. For the SeapHox we added a configuration parameter to delay the measurement for this reason. These reasons certainly make the SeaFET a poor match for use on a moving platform. I hope this clarifies your questions about the SeaFET. Please review the attached paper and let us know if you have additional questions.
