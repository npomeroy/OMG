While working in synchrony with other teams investigating reef ecology, the OCC Team focuses on studying carbonate chemistry, carbonate budgets and ocean warming . At work underwater: The OCC Team Topside: How to Edit this Book Welcome to the online knowledge base of the OCC Team. This started as the OCC Mission Guide, a reference manual to help consolidate best practices for conducting OCC team operations at sea. As of 2020, it has evolved into an online living book, written in R Markdown and compiled into book with bookdown,published via GitHub Pages. The current live version of the book that you can bookmark is here. All OCC team members are encouraged to not only use it as a resource but help it grow by adding and editing content as OCC projects, methods and missions continue to change and grow. Anyone may suggest edits to the contents of the OMG by forking the OMG repository from Noah via GitHub, pushing any changes back to GitHub, after which they may be approved for incorporation into the master copy of the OMG. Once you have forked the repo onto your local machine, the HTML version of the OMG may be accessed offline by simply opening the index.html file in the folder “OMG/docs” A .PDF file of the book is also generated every time the book is built, that also ends up in the “OMG/docs” folder. Fork the repo from Noah via GitHub. Edit any existing chapter by simply editing its .Rmd file in R studio or create a new chapter by creating a new .Rmd file in the root OMG folder. Build the book to see your edits in the form of the built book. Commit your changes via GitHub Desktop (or via R if you have setup GitHub to play nicely with R.) In GitHub, open a Pull Request to have your edits considered for integration into the master branch. The Best How to Guide for Authoring Books with R Markdown is written by Yihui Xie and is found right here If you need some tips for your R Markdown formatting, this cheat sheet is great. "],

["water.html", "2 CTD and DIC Water Sampling Field Guide 2.1 Waypoint and metadata collection 2.2 CTD CAST 2.3 Water Sample Collection 2.4 Water sample Processing 2.5 Mercuric Chloride Emergency Procedures", " 2 CTD and DIC Water Sampling Field Guide If available hands on deck and conditions allow, please conduct the CTD downcast and the water sample collection simultaneously. 2.1 Waypoint and metadata collection Use the OCC provided GPS unit to collect a waypoint when the CTD downcast begins. Record all metadata on provided data sheet. 2.2 CTD CAST Ensure that the CTD line is connected to the top of the CTD frame by 1 shackles. Tie non-CTD end of the CTD line to the boat with a bowline or clip off with carabiner. Flake CTD line on deck. When the coxswain says the CTD can go over the side, raise the CTD switch to the “ON” position, and loudly say, “ON!” then lower it over the side until the top of the frame is 1 meter below the surface of the water to begin the 1 minute soaking period, either holding the line or cleating off the line to maintain the CTD at soaking depth. After 1 minute soak, ask the coxswain for the current depth so you know how far you can lower the CTD without it hitting the bottom (5-10 feet less line than the bottom depth). Un-cleat the CTD line if it was cleated and begin the CTD cast by pulling the CTD frame up until the top ring of the frame emerges from the water, then begin gradually lowering at a consistent rate, hand over hand, until the CTD gets to the target depth (using the markings on the line to estimate depth). Once the target depth is reached, pull the CTD back on board. Once the CTD is back on board, lower the switch to “OFF”, and loudly say “OFF!” 2.3 Water Sample Collection Prime the Niskin Bottle, ensuring the petcock and the air bleed valve are closed. Clip off the boat side of the niskin line to the boat. Near the end of the the CTD soaking time, lower the weight and the open Niskin bottle over the side so the top of the Niskin is at 1m depth (surface of water at the BLACK mark drawn on Niskin line). Clip the messenger on to the line When the CTD begins its downcast, send the messenger to trigger the Niskin to close. Ensure no air bubbles are trapped inside the Niskin and bottle sits vertically in the water column before firing the messenger. 2.4 Water sample Processing Designate roles: bottle filler, mercuric chloride (HgCl2) handler, data recorder. NOTE: Supersaturated mercuric chloride solution is extremely dangerous; use the utmost caution when dealing with the chemical. All personnel working with it are required to wear eye protection. The mercuric chloride handler is also required to where disposable nitrile gloves. In the event of contact with any part of the body, wash the area profusely. If contact is made with eyes, abort operations, rinse continuously with fresh water (or salt if fresh has run out), alert the ship and return ASAP. Remove a bottle and its stopper from the storage tote and insert the tygon tubing to the bottom of the bottle. With the tygon tubing attached to the Niskin bottle dispensing nipple, open the Niskin bottle valve and allow for three complete flushings of the bottle to occur before stopping the sample collection (i.e. start the collection and count how long it takes for the bottle to overflow and then allow that to occur for 2x the required fill time…ie. if the bottle fills in 20 seconds, allow the sample water flow to flush the bottle for 60 seconds). Attention must be given to how the sample water enters the bottle. Care should be given to ensure that smooth water flow into the bottle is maintained and that no bubbles are created during the dispensing of sample. Any bubbles introduced to the sample will alter the pCO2 within the sample water and produce inaccurate DIC results. After the appropriate flushing time, shut off the Niskin valve to stop the water flow, while at the same time ensuring the tygon tubing doesn't come off the bottom of the sample bottle. Once the flow is shut off, pinch the tubing and in one motion remove it from the bottle. This “pinch and remove” action with the tubing should establish a consistent head-space in all the sample bottles. The meniscus of the sample should be about 1 cm below the neck of the bottle (see picture.) Once the proper head space is established, pipette 200ul of HgCl2 saturated solution into the sample bottle Use the syringe containing vacuum grease to make 3-5 vertical “stripes” of grease on a clean, dry stopper. Insert the greased stopper until fully seated in the bottle, then twist until the grease completely seals the bottle contents. The vertical stripes of grease allow for gases to escape the bottle neck while the stopper is being inserted. Having the stopper clean/dry ensures that other than sample water isn't introduced into the bottle. Twisting the stopper, once it has been fully seated into the neck of the bottle, ensures a smooth distribution of grease within the sample bottle's neck and an air tight seal. Use the rubber band and plastic collar to lock down the stopper inside the bottle. Once secured, softly invert the bottle 1-2x to mix the HgCl2 with the water sampleand secure the sample bottle in the field container.

Skin: Immediately flush with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove any contaminated clothing. Inhalation: Remove to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Ingestion: Only induce vomiting if directed to do so by medical personnel.

The next eight digits represent the current year, month, and day. The next four digits represent the current time to the minute. The file extension indicates the file format and should not be changed. If you change it, the file extension that you specify becomes part of the name, and the required extension is appended. For example, the file named 911936_20090522_1613.rsk contains data for a logger with a serial number of 911936 whose data was downloaded in 2009 on May 22 at 4:13 pm. 5.2 Seabird Electronics SBE56 STR As of 2020, the OCC team is not buying anymore SBE56 sensors due to history of inadequate endurance we’ve experienced with them. We have determined that units within a certain range of serial number are high risk for low endurance (Ari knows the bad ones!) Just like the RBR Solo v3, the SBE56 is programmed to sample every 5 minutes for 30S. The user mnual for the SBE56 can be found here. Here are the basic steps to program the SBE56: Open SeatermV2 and select SBE56 from the instruments menu. Open the housing with the custom endcap remover and connect the SBE 56 to your PC via a USB mini cable. When a successful connection is made, you will notice a “Device Identified” notification in the bottom left of the screen and you will see the serial number of the unit you have connected to in the upper left of the application window and in the current configuration window. Edit the configuration options as follows sample period = 5 minutes (300 seconds) set time to UTC by clicking the “time options” button on the right and select “GreenWich Mean Time.” check the box for clear memory check the boxy for clear events check the box for new battery installed (if it is relatively new, which if it is just back from refurbishment, it should be) set the date and time for the unit to begin sampling for a time is prior to the day it will be deployed When you are done editing the configuration of the SBE56, click the “Update Configuration” button and confirm the changes you want to make when the pop-up window asks you to do so. When you have finished, you should see the notification in the bottom left that says, “finished configuring device - success.” At this point double check that the “current configuration” window on the left shows the parameters that you intended to program the instrument with. At this point, you can disconnect the SBE56, install a new dessicant in its endcap, examine its o-rings for any hairs and re-seal the housing. It is now ready for taping and installation in the deployment bracket.

We call this “conditioning time”. Conditioning in the wetcap with artificial seawater will not work because ionic exchange will quickly change the pH of the small volume of water in the wetcap, thus not actually conditioning the instrument. ##How to Set the SeaFet to polled mode** If needed, install new batteries in the SeaFet (12 Ds) Remove dummy plug from endcap of SeaFet and connect SeaFet to computer with USB cable Open SeaFetCom software Swipe magnet over magnetic switch to “activate” batteries (indicator light by magnetic switch will blink green) Press “connect” Open settings and confirm operational mode is “polled mode” Click “upload” to make sure Click “disconnect” 7.2 Programming the SeaFet for Deployment (After it has already been warming up in polled, aka low power sleep mode for at least 24hrs) In the dry lab prior to deployment At least 24 hours prior to deployment: install and activate internal batteries. To activate internal batteries, swipe the magnet to the target until the indicator LED starts flashing green (this may take a few attempts). Alternatively, connect the instrument to the computer and place in periodic mode following instructions below. Remove the dummy plug and connect data logger cable. Open SeaFETCom and select “Connect to SeaFET” to begin communications with instrument. Sync instrument clock with computer clock: Sensor -&amp;gt; Set Clock, “Sync Time” . Instrument time should be in UTC. To access SeaFET deployment settings, select the “SeaFET Settings” button in the dashboard window or Sensor -&amp;gt; “SeaFET Settings”. Use the following settings: General Operational Mode: Periodic Sample Interval : 1 min Offset : 0 sec Number of samples in average: 30 Number of frames in burst: 1 Enable Sampling Window : If using, check box and set appropriate start and end dates *We haven't been able to make this work well, so don't use sampling interval for now* Internal Device Logging ** Logging level:** INFO Maximum log file size: 9999 KB Telemetry Serial Baud Rate: 57600 Transmitted Frame Format: FULL_ASCII Instrument Logging Frame Format: FULL_ASCII Log File Creation Method : By file size Maximum Size: 9999 KB Uncheck“legacy format” Processing Salinity : 35 psu External Pump - no external pump in use CTD – no CTD in use Note: For RAMP deployments, the SeaFET will be deployed in periodic mode , in which it will sample at a specified interval and burst size and go to sleep in between measurements. The instrument can be put in polled mode, in which it remains in a low power sleep state until woken by an external command, for long-term storage or shipping. Continuous mode should only be used when the instrument is powered by an external power source. Activiate the instrument prior to getting on the small boat Start deployment by selecting the “Start” button in the SeaFETCom dashboard or Sensor -&amp;gt; “Start”. Disconnect from SeaFET, remove data logger cable, and replace dummy plug. On the small boat Immediately prior to deployment, remove wet cap. Remove two stainless steel plugs and store securely. Invert the instrument to pour the storage solution from the wet cap into a sink. Using a 5/32\" hex driver or Allen key, remove the three 10-32 x 5/8\" socket head cap screws from the wet cap. Remove the wet cap. Install foul guard. Place instrument on a flat surface with the sensor end cap up. Place the electrode foul guard over the electrode. Insert the three 10-32 x 5/8\" socket head cap screws removed from wet cap and tighten completely. Sensor end cap should not be exposed to air for more than a few seconds, so submerge in water if not immediately deploying underwater. Retrieving the SeaFet Upon recovery of the instrument, stick the wetcap end into a bucket of seawater for return to the ship or remove foul guard and replace wet cap. Ensure wet cap is filled with sterilized, artificial seawater or filtered seawater. Keep the sensor end wet at all times (it can be without water no more than an hour). 7.3 Downloading Data from the SeaFet** Remove dummy plug, attach data logger cable, and connect to SeaFETCOM software. Select “Transfer Files” from the SeaFETCom Dashboard. In the “Local Filesystem” pane, press “Browse” to select the local folder on the computer that will receive downloaded files. In the “Instrument Filesystem” pane, select the files to be downloaded from the SeaFET and press the “&amp;lt;-” button to transfer selected files. A Seafet deployment creates 2 file types: a log file that contains metadata about the deployment and the data file (may be more than one data file) If the instrument will be used in the near future, place in polled mode following deployment steps above. This low-power stand-by mode will maintain a continuous current flow to the sensing element and eliminate the need for a 24-hour warmup. If the instrument will not be used in the near future, deactivate internal batteries by swiping the magnet over the target until the LED flashes red. 7.4 Properly Store the SeaFet It is crucial to store the SeaFET sensors with clean seawater in the wet cap. If seawater is not available, artificial seawater will suffice. The internal KCl reference gel in the DuraFET will become dry if left out of water, resulting in calibration drift and potentially causing irreversible damage. Do not store the SeaFET with freshwater in the wet cap, as this will change the chemistry of the external reference electrode. If storing or shipping the SeaFET, disconnect the batteries in SeaFETCOM: Connect the SeaFET to SeaFETCom Navigate to Sensor &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Disconnect for Storage. This will disconnect the isolated battery pack from the external reference sensor to retain battery life. 7.5 Email Exchanges about Seafet for reference Notes on SeaFet soaking and response time February 12, 2018 Hi Noah, Yes indeed, if you are concerned about the time it takes to stabilize, you could combat this by immersing in some seawater that is close to the sites parameters ahead of time. Know however, that having the SeaFET running in the small volume of water within the wetcap, it will quickly become altered from normal regarding the small volume and ionic exchange. (This might be the reason why you mentioned the pH value of 6 in the wetcap currently.) Ideally one would want to have a larger water volume however this might require some creativity to accomplish ! Proposed settings look fine ! Regarding a specific start time: Within SeaFETCom - SeaFET Settings - In the SeaFET General Settings Tab you can select the desired Start date, but I not Believe you can specify the time of day. But looking into the firmware commands it appears the SeaFET can be programmed with a start time as well. At the SeaFET's command prompt, enter the following commands as an example: “set –samplwin true” and then \"set –samstart yyyy/mm/dd.hh:mm:ss Note these commands can be sent using the “Command Terminal” found under Sensor Menu - Advanced in SeaFETCom, or through TeraTerm direct serial connection. I believe programming in periodic mode, with a delayed start up time would achieve the same effect. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. Kind Regards, Darrell February 9, 2018 Email from Darrel at Seabird Tech Support: Hello Noah, Thank You for your email ! Is 24hrs adequate for the instrument to “warm up” in polled mode (I believe you've called this “conditioning mode” before) prior to deployment or are multiple days necessary? The time of ** SeaFET ****'s sensors adjusting to the in-situ environment can vary. Really it depends on how different the water is from the storage solution. When we perform calibration it can take anywhere for a day, to several days - but we are looking for high level of stability. When deploying the **** SeaFET **** the pH values may take a couple of days for the readings to stabilize to the environment.** How long can the sensor be exposed to air before damage to the sensor occurs? (We are wondering about best practices for taking the instrument from the small boat into the water. For instance, the wetcap remains on the instrument until we get to the dive site. We get to the dive site and prepare our SCUB gear, then remove the wetcap and affix the protective copper endcap over the sensor - at this point, 1 to several minutes my pass before it is actually submerged in the ocean when we roll in the water.) I do not see a problem here. For damage to occur to the ISFET it will have to become dry. I would say best practice would be no more than 1 hour. But a couple of hours will not cause damage, just likely additional time to reach stability in the new environment. The external reference can become dry without damage - but some further conditioning time would be expected. Is setting the instrument to periodic mode with a future sample start date considered a low power mode, comparable to “polled mode” Yes I believe this would achieve the same, however you would need to ensure to switch to polled mode if this is method use during deployment. If you have an external controller, polled is likely the better option for use. If you were using periodic mode and an external device collecting the SeaFET's data - this would rely on the two systems have no change in the their clocks. Polled mode would be better as the external controller would be able to collect data whenever it chooses. I hope this helps ! Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. Kind Regards, Darrell Greg Ikeda Thu, Oct 1, 2015 at 10:44 AM Hi Noah, You've brought up some good questions about the SeaFET- I went ahead and consulted our engineer responsible for this instrument to obtain some more concrete answers. SeaFET soak time: Craig is correct- the SeaFET requires a “conditioning time” that allows the sensors to stabilize before achieving full accuracy. I've attached a paper that explores the best practices for obtaining quality data from the SeaFET. Please reference this document for quality control procedures. From this paper: Upon first contact with seawater, pH sensor voltages relative to both reference electrodes exhibit an asymptotic drift. This conditioning period arises from several sources: Achieving a stable flow of ions across the liquid junction of the internal reference electrode (nominally hours), replacement of Cl – with Br ? in the solid solution of AgCl of the Cl-ISE (nominally days), an ISFET conditioning component, related to the initial power-up of the chip, the exact basis of which is not fully understood (nominally 1 day), and a pressure effect on the ISFET and internal reference electrode through changes in the liquid junction potential that may become important if the sensor is deployed more than 20 m below the surface (nominally 1 h). Factors 1–3 can be addressed by operating the pH sensor continuously in seawater (never powering off the ISFET) for one week prior to deployment and taking care to keep the sensor wetted in natural seawater during transport. SeaFET response time: It very much depends on the system at hand. After initial conditioning (as described above): With continuous water flow, either naturally occurring or forced, the response is practically instantaneous. If the sensor has to re-condition to a new volume of water for every measurement, it could take up to 30sec to converge to the right number. For the SeapHox we added a configuration parameter to delay the measurement for this reason. These reasons certainly make the SeaFET a poor match for use on a moving platform. I hope this clarifies your questions about the SeaFET. Please review the attached paper and let us know if you have additional questions.

O-rings you need for the two styles of PUCs. Order from McMaster Carr. The o-rings should easily last a year. I would suggest replacing them annually. Old style cap —- dash# 2-153. McM. 9452K174 New style cap—- dash# 2-236 McM 9452K165 1/6/2018 email about new firmware: It gives you 30 sec to hit a key about the pump starts running. I also reduced the pump run time to 10 seconds. You can now specify the month, day, hour and minute that the PUC will sample so you can set it up days in advance.

The processing of each batch is typically completed in 4 weeks. Below is an example of a typical processing timeline 14.2.2 Preparation Work ID Tags Assign a unique ID to both plates of each Calcification Accretion Unit (CAU) using the CAU Plate ID naming convention SiteID_RecoveryYear_4-digitSerial#_PlateLocation (“U” - upper plate, “L” - lower plate) e.g. PAL01_2012_5319_U; PAL01_2012_5319_L Using a pencil, pre-label the following with the CAU Plate ID (e.g. PAL01_2012_5319_U): Paper tray A - blank index card 12.7 x 20.32cm (5” x 8”) folded into 12.7 x 12.7cm (5” x 5”) paper tray Paper tray B - same as above Filterpaper 11cm diameter, #1, &gt;11μm particle retention (e.g. Whatman No.1001-110) Insert the corresponding Filter paper into the fold of Paper tray B and store in a container. Place Paper tray A in a separate container. Store both containers away from moisture and direct sunlight. See I. Step 8 for pre-weighing instructions. Print Glass Dish Labels on waterproof paper using the template in Section VII.C.1. Attach each label on one side of the glass dish with tape. Print the Plate Photo ID tags on waterproof paper using the template in Section VII.C.2.There are 4 tags, one for each surface of the CAU to be photographed: Upper Plate, Top Side Upper Plate, Bottom Side Lower Plate, Top Side Lower Plate, Bottom Side An example of a plate photo ID: PAL01_2012_5319_U_T Using an analytical balance, pre-weigh the following and record the value (up to 3 decimal points) in the ESD Apex CAU Mission App (or the CAU Data Entry tool for ESD-CREP users, see Section VI p. 20): Paper tray A - record the value in Column (‘Paper Tray A Weight [g]’) Paper tray B + Filterpaper - record the value in Column (‘Filter &amp; Paper Tray B Dry Weight [g]’) Re-sealable Bag ID Pre-label re-sealable plastic bags 0.95L (1 quart) with the CAU Plate ID. The filter residue will be stored in this bag for archiving Database Using the ESD Apex CAU Mission App (or the CAU Data Entry tool for ESD-CREP users, see Section VI p. 20), have the Data Management team enter the CAU Site IDs (e.g. PAL01) and 4-digit CAU Serial #s (e.g. 5319) for each unit to be processed To calculate the “Soak Time” of each unit, record the CAU “Deployment Date” and “Recovery Date” in Column CA and CB, respectively. Record any other additional field data in the spreadsheet (e.g. coordinates, depth, comments, etc.). When using the ESD Apex CAU Mission App, soak time is calculated automatically. Pre-heat Drying Oven Oven (Heratherm OGS-180) settings: Temperature: 70°C (140°F) Damper: level 3 (mid-high) Prepare 5% HCl acid solution in 2-liter bottles One batch (20-30 units) of CAUs will require about 10-15, 2-liter bottles of 5% HCl acid solution in order to completely dissolve calcified materials. More may be needed depending on the amount of accreted CaCO3. To dilute full-strength HCl acid (1.18 g/mL, 36.5 molar mass, 37% conc.) into 5% solution, use the recommended ratio below: 2L stock: 225 ml HCl 1775 ml deionized/distilled H2O 1L stock: 112.5 ml HCl 887.5 ml deionized/distilled H2O ** Be sure to ADD ACID TO WATER to avoid excessive heating, violent boiling or splashing of concentrated acid that could result from the exothermic reaction. “Do as you oughta, add acid to water!” - Dr. Anne Cohen, WHOI ** Acid solutions with a higher (&gt;5% HCl concentration) may be prepared and used if desired for processing CAUs from heavily calcified regions (American Samoa, PRIAs), however concentrations greater than or equal to 15% HCl require special PPE including fume hood utilization. 14.2.3 CAU Processing Steps see Section IV, p.11 for sample processing timeline and Section VII.A, p.36 for sample daily task guide 14.2.3.1 Dissassembling and Photo-documentation Thaw a batch of CAUs (typically 20-30 units) in the sink for at least 12 hours. Do not thaw over water. Disassemble the plates of each CAU by removing the hex nuts and washers using two 1/4\" wrenches (one to hold the unit steady). Make sure to maintain plate identity (upper vs lower plate, top vs bottom side of plate) and the CAU Plate ID. Carefully rinse each plate in a saltwater rinse basin (if saltwater is not readily available, freshwater may be used) to remove loose sediment, sand and mobile fauna. Discard any mobile fauna that may have fallen off during rinsing. Fill each pre-labeled glass dish with saltwater(or freshwater). Place each CAU plate with the top plate facing upwards into its corresponding glass dish. Ensure that the plate and any encrusting fauna are completely submerged in water. Add more water if necessary (see Section V.C for additional instructions) Attach a DSLR camera to a camera copy stand or a tripod. Arrange lighting such that the plate is fully illuminated and no glare is visible to the camera ** If using a Nikon D7000 camera mounted on a copy stand kit with attached lights, see Section V, p. 12 for tethering protocol and recommended settings (f/8, ISO400, AWB). It is recommended to tether the camera to a computer and save the photos directly to the computer’s local drive (while using the camera’s SD card as a backup drive). Designate a folder where the CAU photoset will be stored directly. (May 2019 - ESD General (T:) Drive at: T: organized by Year and Cruise Mission, or Island Code for shore-based missions or those from the Atlantic.) Photograph the top and bottom of each plate, first with the Plate Photo ID tag and then a 2nd image without the tag. (If pieces of calcified material fall off during the photographing process, retain the pieces with the plate to be used during the decalcification process). From the designated CAU photoset folder, confirm that both plate photos (with and without the Plate Photo ID tag) are in focus. After photographing both sides of each plate, each CAU photoset folder should have 8 photos. The photos should be later on renamed with the following naming convention: a) With Plate Photo ID tag: SiteID_RecoveryYear_4-digitSerial#_PlateLocation (“U” - upper plate or “L” - lower plate)_PlateSurface (“T” - top plate or “B” - bottom plate)_ID.jpg b) Without Plate Photo ID tag: SiteID_RecoveryYear_4-digitSerial#_PlateLocation (“U” - upper plate, “L” lower plate)_PlateSurface (“T” - top plate, “B” - bottom plate).jpg Example: PAL01_2012_5319_U_T_ID.jpg – Upper Plate, Top Side with tag PAL01_2012_5319_U_T.jpg – Upper Plate, Top Side PAL01_2012_5319_U_B_ID.jpg – Upper Plate, Bottom Side with tag PAL01_2012_5319_U_B.jpg – Upper Plate, Bottom Side PAL01_2012_5319_L_T_ID.jpg – Lower Plate, Top Side with tag PAL01_2012_5319_L_T.jpg – Lower Plate, Top Side PAL01_2012_5319_L_B_ID.jpg – Lower Plate, Bottom Side with tag PAL01_2012_5319_L_B.jpg – Lower Plate, Bottom Side After photographing all units, if the CAUs were submerged in seawater, carefully rinse each plate in freshwater. If the CAUs were submerged in freshwater, skip the rinsing process. Be sure to remove all hex nuts and washers that may still be attached at the center of the plate. Hex nuts and washers can be covered by calcified material and difficult to see. Inspect each side of each plate to ensure that there are no washers or hex nuts present. If a hex nut or washer is covered in calcified material, remove the hardware and chip off the calcified material from the hardware. Retain the removed material with the rest of the plate. Place each plate and any dislodged pieces of calcified material on its corresponding Paper Tray A, then onto a drying rack and placed in the fume hood. The drying rack can be left in a fume hood to air dry at room temperature indefinitely (minimum of 24 hours), until they are dried in the oven. ** Drying at room temperature before placing in the oven can help reduce the time the plates remain in the oven. ** Wash and rinse the glass dishes but keep the labels on. The same glass dishes will be used during the HCl acid decalcification process. 14.2.3.2 Determining the weight of the CAU plate After a minimum air-drying period of 24 hours, place the plate assembly (plate, dislodged pieces of calcified material and Paper Tray A) in the oven labeled “Non-HCl” to dry at 60°C for 24 hours. ** Check that the internal temperature remains consistent. If not, minor adjustments should be made to the oven temperature and damper settings. After 24 hours, remove the plate assembly and allow it to come to room temperature (roughly 10 min). Weigh the entire plate assembly. In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App (or CAU Data Entry tool for ESD-CREP users), record the weight to at least 3 decimal places under the column ‘Drying 1 [24 h] [paper tray + CAU plate] [g]’. Return the plate assembly in the oven. Dry the CAU plates for another 24 hours. Remove the plate assembly and allow it to come to room temperature (roughly 10 min). Weigh the entire plate assembly. In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App (or CAU Data Entry tool for ESD-CREP users), record the 2nd weight to at least 3 decimal places under the column ‘Drying 2 [48 h] [paper tray + CAU plate] [g]’. Compare the current weight from the previous weight: If the difference in weight is less than 0.1g, the plates are considered dry and no further drying needs to occur. This is automatically calculated by the ESD Apex CAU Mission App and denoted by the ‘Plate Dry’ column on the far right saying ‘YES’. If the difference in weight is greater than 0.1 g, return the plates to the oven for another 24 hours. Repeat III.B Steps 5-10 until the difference in weight is less than 0.1 g. 14.2.3.3 Decalcification of CaCO3 in Hydrochloric Acid Be sure to wear proper PPE when handling acid contaminated objects (steps 1-9) including gloves, safety glasses, and lab coat. Ensure that the plate is fully dry (mass lost between last two weighing will have been less than 0.1g) and the weight of the plate assembly and Paper Tray A has been recorded. Place the individual plates in the pre-labeled glass dishes. Keep Paper Tray A and place under the glass dish. Chip off large pieces of calcified materials (e.g. CCA, coral, shells, etc.) and grind using a mortar and pestle. Return the pulverized forms in the glass dish. Fill the glass dish midway with 5% HCl (or otherwise chosen concentration) acid solution or until the entire CAU plate is fully submerged in acid. Add HCl acid slowly as the solution may overflow when bubble formation/decalcification begins. The overflow most definitely occurs when dissolving plates from Rose and Swains Atoll. When decalcification has slowed (12-24 hours): Scrape leftover material from the CAU plates with a razor blade into the glass dish. (See III.C, Step 8-15). Grind pieces of calcified materials that may still be present and return in the glass dish. Using acid-resistant gloves, sort through the scraped fleshy material in the glass dish and feel for any calcified materials. Some calcified material can be completely covered by a boundary layer of fleshy material. If present, manually tease the fleshy material and grind the calcified material to allow decalcification to continue. If there are more calcified materials in the dish, but no obvious decalcification occurring (no bubble formation), decant the used acid solution and drain the fleshy material into another pre-labeled containers (beakers, glass dish, etc). Add new 5% HCl acid solution (*or desired concentration) in the first glass dish to continue dissolving the remaining calcified materials. Repeat III.C, Steps 5b)-e) until all CaCO3 is fully dissolved. Additional 5% HCl acid solution (*or desired concentration) may need to be added 2-4x, depending on the amount of CaCO3 present. Using 5% HCl acid (*or desired concentration) in a squeeze bottle, thoroughly rinse the tools (gloves, mortar and pestle, razor/scraper) into the glass dish. When the CAU PVC plates have been scraped clean (fleshy/calcified material completely removed from either side and edges of the plate), rinse all sides of the plates with 5% acid (*or desired concentration) into the glass dish. Have a bowl of freshwater ready to scrub and rinse the CAU PVC plates once they are completely clear of particles from the previous step. Pat to dry. Place the CAU PVC plate on its corresponding Paper Tray A. Place the rinsed CAU PVC plates in the oven at 60°C for 24 hours on top of the corresponding Paper Tray A. Remove the plate from the oven and allow to come to room temperature (roughly 10 min). Weigh the clean and dry CAU PVC plate without the underlying paper tray. - *Paper Tray A can be discarded after the CAU PVC plates have been weighed and recorded. In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App, record the weight to at least 3 decimal places under the column ‘CAU PVC Dry Weight [g]’. Collect the clean and weighed CAU PVCs and store for redeployment/archiving. 14.2.3.4 Vacuum filtration of fleshy material Be sure to wear proper PPE when handling acid contaminated objects (steps 1-4) including gloves, safety glasses, and lab coat. Using a 4-liter Buchner funnel, a plastic mesh layer (with attached pull string) and the corresponding pre-weighed filter paper, vacuum filter the acid bath and remaining fleshy material for each CAU plate. Use a freshwater squeeze bottle to rinse contents of the glass dish into the funnel. If the volume of fleshy material is sufficient to clog the filter paper, a 2nd pre-labeled and pre-weighed filter paper (see III.D, Step 2, a-c) can be used to filter the remaining volume of acid bath and fleshy material: Label an additional filter paper and paper tray with its corresponding CAU Plate ID (e.g. PAL01_2012_5319_U). In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App, record the weight of the 2nd filter paper + paper tray to at least 3 decimal places in the column ‘Addtl Filter &amp; Paper tray B Dry Weight [g]’. If filtering has slowed down, use a spatula/teaspoon to gently scrape the surface of the filter paper to allow more solution to filter through. Filtering can take &gt;5 mins depending the amount of fleshy material in the acid bath. When filtration is completed, place the filter paper on its corresponding Paper Tray B and onto a drying rack. The drying rack should be left in a fume hood to air dry at room temperature (minimum of 24 hours). The filter paper can continue to air dry at room temperature, indefinitely, until they are dried in the oven. 14.2.3.5 Determining the weight of the fleshy material Be sure to wear proper PPE (gloves) when handling acid contaminated filters in this section. After a minimum air-drying period of 24 hours, place the filter paper assembly (filter paper and Paper Tray B) in the oven to dry at 60°C for 24 hours. ** Check that the internal temperature remains consistent. If not, minor adjustments should be made to the oven temperature and damper settings. After 24 hours, remove the filterpaper assembly and allow it to come to room temperature (roughly 10min). Weigh the entire filterpaper assembly. In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App, record the weight to at least 3 decimal places under “Filters” &gt;‘Drying 1 [24 h] [paper tray + filterpaper] [g]’. Return the filterpaper assembly to the oven. Dry the filterpaper for another 24 hours. Remove the filterpaper assembly and allow it to come to room temperature (roughly 10min). Weigh the entire filterpaper assembly In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App, record the weight to at least 3 decimal places under “Filters” &gt;‘Drying 2 [48 h] [paper tray + filterpaper] [g]’. Compare the current weight from the previous weight: If the difference in weight is less than 0.1g, the plates are considered dry and no further drying/weighing needs to occur. ** In the ESD Apex CAU Mission App, the column to the far right called “Filter Dry” has been formatted to change from ‘NO’ to “YES” if the difference in weight is less than 0.1g. b. If the difference in weight is greater than 0.1 g, return the plates to the oven for another 24 hours. Repeat III.E Steps 5-10 until the difference in weight is less than 0.1 g. After recording the final filterpaper assembly dry weight, place the filterpaper and Paper tray B in its corresponding re-sealable bag for archiving. Ensure the bag is labeled properly using the CAU Plate ID naming convention: *SiteID_RecoveryYear_4-digitSerial#_PlateLocation (“U” - upper plate, “L” - lower plate)* 14.2.4 Camera tethering and CAU plate photo-documentation via Nikon Camera Control Pro 2 Refer to the brand/model user documentation/manual if using a different camera and setup 14.2.4.1 Installing the software For ESD-CREP users, the installation instructions and software product key can be accessed in the network folder T:\\general\\ProjectGroup\\Ocean Acidification\\CAUs\\Analysis\\CAU Processing SOP, Data sheet, Labels\\CAU SOPs 2015\\CAUSOP_NikonD7000Settings.pdf 14.2.4.2 Connecting the camera to the computer Connect Nikon DSLR camera (Nikon D7000 with AF-S Micro NIKKOR 60mm f\\2.8G ED lens) to the computer via USB mini cable Start the Nikon Camera Control Pro 2 application Turn the camera ON Once connected, the connection status of the camera in use will be displayed on the Camera Control Pro window If using the software for the FIRST TIME: Click on “Exposure 1” under the Camera Control tabs and change the settings of the following: Shutter speed: 1/50 sec Aperture: f/8 b.

In order to request access to the application, please contact ITS or the Data Management department for assistance. Interface: The web application is categorized in to four main sections: Home Data Entry Data Summary Audit 14.3.1.1 Home This page breaks down the number of CAUs that still need to be weighed by Plate, Site, and Island. The ** Valid Plate, Valid Filter, and Filter Subplate fields are explained in another section* 14.3.1.2 Data Entry The Data Entry section is where you will go to enter all the weights that you will find. This table shows all the data that has been entered. Editing the plate weights and filter weights are actually recorded in separate pages by clicking on items 6 and 7. Below is an image of what you’ll see when you navigate to the Data Entry page. a) **Breadcrumb Bar** – use this to navigate through the different levels of the application b) **Finder Drop Down** – use this to select the column you wish to search by c) **Search Field** – enter search criteria here d) **Search Button** – click this button to execute your search criteria or hit ‘Enter’ e) **Row Selecto**r – choose the number of rows you wish to display on the page f) **Action** – Allows you to download the table, and perform more advanced functions g) **Edit Plate Weights** – Navigates to a new page where data for the CAU plates are entered h) **Edit Filter Weights** – Navigates to a new page where data for the CAU filters are entered Edit Plate Weights Page The Edit Plate and Edit Filter pages are identical; however, we are going to work with the Edit Plate page below. Click on the Edit Plate Weights button (shown in figure 2) to navigate to the screen below: a) Filter By Island – Drop down list of islands shown in table b) Rows to Display – Select number of rows to display c) Select drying cycle Select the name of the column you wish to edit. Each item in the drop down menu corresponds to a column in the table. Once you’ve selected the cycle, click Apply Filters to begin inputting data into that column d) Note how only one column can be edited at a time. This application was designed to be used with software that inputs data directly from a scale which uses a tab delimiter e) Apply Filters – must be clicked each time a change is made on items 1 through 3 f) Edit Filter Weights - Navigates to a new page where CAU filter weight data is inputted g) Save – allows you to submit your changes and displays the number of records that have been updated h) Calculate – Filters any records that have been completed from the table. Once filtered, these CAU plates will be used in the calcification rates calculations. The following criteria must be met before a record is filtered from the Edit Plate Weights and Edit Filter Weights pages: * Edit Plate Weights + The **Plate_Dry** column says **YES** (This value determines whether a plate is dry) + The **Paper_Tray_Weight** is NOT empty (Entering ‘0’ will suffice) + The **CAU_Pvc_Dry_Weight** is NOT empty (Entering ‘0’ will suffice) * Edit Filter Weights + The **Filter_Dry** column says **YES** (This value determines whether a filter is dry) + The **Filter_Paper_Tray_Dry_Weight** is NOT blank (Entering ‘0’ will suffice) If you notice that a record is not being filtered from the table by clicking on the Calculate button, ensure the three criteria mentioned above are being met. Note: CAU plates will NOT be accounted for in the final calculations until they have been filtered from this page using the Calculate button. Unlike the Save button, this button will not display how many records have been filtered from the screen. Edit Filter Weights Page If you click on the Edit Filter Weights button (see figure 3), it will take you to a screen identical to the Edit Plate Weights page. The difference here is the type of columns it shows and an Overflow button. Overflow Page Overview Clicking on the Overflow button will bring you to a separate page that displays any subplates that have been created whether they have been dried or not. The Overflow page is used to add additional filters (subplates) in the event a filter is too small or heavy for the scale. Explaining how to add, edit, and delete a subplate is explained in another user guide. Plate/Filter Dry Column You will see a column called, Plate Dry or Filter Dry in some tables. This column automatically updates each time you save your changes. In a nutshell, the column will take the difference between the previous weight and the current weight. If the difference is outside of the range – 1 g to 0.1 g then the column will say NO if the plate is not dry and YES if it is dry. ** Note: There are times when a plate or filter will actually get heavier between drying cycles due to the moisture in the air; however, a plate/filter is considered dry if it gains no more than 0.1 grams. Comments Column This column can be modified by selecting the drying cycle to Comments. The comments field allows you to record information about a particular record in the database. Once you make your changes, be sure to click the Save button. ** Note: The ‘Edit Plate Weights’ and ‘Edit Filter Weights’ are two tables that separates the table shown in the ‘Data Entry’ screen due to the number of columns it has. However, even though it may seem that each page has its own Comments field, both pages actually shares that field Valid Plate/Filter Codes There are three main codes associated with these columns: * N = record is not dry * Y = record is dry and will be included in the calculation if both the upper and lower plates are ‘Y’ or ‘F’ * F = record was force-dried and will be included in the calculation if the upper and lower plates are ‘Y’ or ‘F’ * B = record is considered bad and is not included in the end calculations ** Note: In order to modify the valid plate/filter columns, you will need update access to the CAU_ANALYSIS table inside Oracle SQL Developer. As long as these two fields have a value of either ‘Y’ or ‘F’, the record will be included in the end calculations 14.3.1.3 Data summary This section allows you to view the calcification rates by unit, site, or island. You can also export the information to either an HTML or CSV file by clicking the Download option shown below. Tools built-in to the interactive reports can be used to filter the data and create tables for graphical analysis. Each report has the same options to choose from in the Actions drop-down menu. If you need more information about what a particular feature does, click on the Help option. The Data Summary page is where you will see the following calculations: * Net Weight * Final Material Dry Weight * Final Fleshy Weight * Calcification Rate By Plate There are three additional report pages: * Calcification Rate By Unit (shows calculation by grouping the upper and lower plates together) * Calcification Rate By Site (shows calculation by grouping the sites together) * Calcification Rate By Island (shows calculation by grouping the islands together) Generating Reports with Calcification Rate By Island This page displays the calcification rates by island and includes a bar graph to help depict the number values. You can filter the report by region name, year, and island as you wish. Once you’ve made your selections, click on the Generate Report button to update the graph and table. ** Note: The table is a graphical depiction of what is shown in the table below and vice versa 14.3.1.4 Audit This page is a read-only summary of what is shown in the Data Entry Summary page with a few additional columns. For each column that can be edited by a user, there are two additional columns that correspond to it: Last Mod By (shows who last modified column) and Last Mod DTM (date, time, month, a record was modified). For example, in the figure shown below, you see the Paper Tray Weight column next to two other fields before the Filter Paper Tray Dry Weight is shown. 14.3.2 Data Entry Tutorial In this tutorial, we will be adding plate weights into our application. A similar process would apply to the filter weights. Click on the Data Entry icon Next, click on the Edit Plate Weights button Let’s say we wish to record the first drying cycle weight for a plate in Baker: and show 25 results per page: Filter By Island – Select Baker Rows to Display – Select 25 Select Drying Cycle – Weight Plate Drying 1 Once you have made your changes, click on the Apply Filters button to see them take effect Click inside the text box to input the new weight using the button on the scale. You should automatically see the weight get entered into the cell and the cursor will jump down to the next record. Repeat until you’ve entered all weights for the first drying cycle. Make sure to hit Save once you are done and change the drying cycle to Weight Plate Drying 2 to begin the next cycle when ready. After you click on Save, a green dialog box will tell you how many rows have been updated with new values as shown in the next figure. Once you see a record in the Plate/Filter Dry column display YES in red, this means the plate/filter is dry. ** Note: The ‘Calculate’ button will not filter a record until a value is entered into the ‘Paper Tray Weight’ and ‘CAU PVC Dry Weight’ fields. Once BOTH the upper and lower plates of a CAU unit have been dried and removed from this table, the unit will get calculated into the final calcification rates which can be seen in the Data Summary section. If a lower or upper plate in a CAU unit is missing, then the entire CAU unit will NOT be included in the end calculations. You can move freely between entering weights for the filters and plates by clicking on the button shown below: 14.3.3 Filter Overflow Tutorial Summary: There will be times when an additional filter is needed in the event a single filter is not large enough to contain the accumulated calcification. In this case, another plate record or “subplate” must be created in order to keep track of the drying cycle weights for each filter. The Overflow page can only be reached from the Edit Filter Weights page. Therefore, navigate to Data Entry &gt; Edit Filter Weights &gt; Overflow: ** Note: If you’re currently entering data in the Edit Filter Weights page, ensure you save your changes before clicking on the Overflow button. The Overflow page will only allow you to view and add subplates, not edit them. In order to add a subplate, choose the Island, Site, and Cau Serial Plate ID, you wish to add from the drop down arrow shown below. The Cau Serial Plate ID drop-down menu will only appear once you have selected a Site. You can click the Reset Filters button to clear your current selections anytime. Once you have selected a Cau Serial Plate ID, the Add Subplate button will appear. Once you’re satisfied with your selection, click the Add Subplate button to add the plate into the database ** NOTE: The Cau Serial Plate ID drop-down list will only show non-dry filters currently in the application. You will see your new subplate in the table shown below. To edit the subplate, navigate back to the Edit Filter Weights page from the breadcrumb bar at the top of the page. Notice how there are now two of the same Cau Serial Plate IDs in the Edit Filter Weights page. The way to distinguish them is by the CAU Analysis ID; this will always be unique. Once created, the subplate is just like any other plate. Add the weight of the additional filter to the Filter Paper Tray Dry Weight column. Deleting a Subplate Navigate back to the Overflow page. If you added a subplate by mistake, click on the pencil icon next to the record you wish to delete in the Overflow page. ** Note: The original plate will always have a lower CAU Analysis ID than its subplates. A window will appear that allows you to view the information before you delete it. If you’re certain you want to remove the record, click the Delete button. If not, click Cancel or exit out of the window. A window prompt should appear asking if you’re certain of your decision. Click Ok. If successful, you should see a green dialog box appear in the top-right corner. "],
