# Data Processing and the Occ Package {#data_processing}
The *occ* package is uploaded to GitHub and can be downloaded directly in R. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, tidy = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, strip.white = TRUE, cache = TRUE)
```

1. Open the *devtools* library.
```{r load_devtools, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
```

2. To download the *occ* package, use the `install_github` command. The repository name is in the form "username/repo". For the *occ* package, the username is "hannahbarkley" and the repo is "occ". This install only need to occur once; however, the *occ* package will need to be reinstalled if there are updates to the package (which is likely).
```{r install_occ, eval = FALSE}
install_github("hannahbarkley/occ")
```

3. Once installed, load the *occ* package.
```{r load_occ}
library(occ)
```
