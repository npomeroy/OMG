## How to Gain Access to the OCC Database

As of April 2020, the OCC team is in the process of working with the data management team to migrate all OCC Team data and metadata to an Oracle database. In order to access this database, a new user must submit an [ITS support ticket](https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/jira/login.jsp?permissionViolation=true&os_destination=%2Fbrowse%2FPICITS-181121%3Ffilter%3D-2&page_caps=&user_role=) to request an Oracle account in addition to requesting an install of SQL Developer. If you'd like to access data via R, you'll also need to request to have ODBC drivers setup. 

## How to Archive Data

After data is qc'd it mus be archived. As of January 2020, the best place to look for all information and guidance related to archiving data is in a [google drive folder setup by Annette](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oq76hN6eOhhJOevwZiO0nX4Gtf0tiJrp).

## How to Connect to the Oracle Database

[Checkout this live SOP on Google Drive for how to get connected to OCC Data in the oracle database](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hVuyRj78kB3NHR4xF-mWZeOZCwYMDNSLSwQc08Af7s/edit#)

## How to Connect to the OCC Oracle Databse Via Oracle SQL Developer

1. Open Oracle SQL Developer
2. On the "Welcome Page" tab, under the "Databases Detected" tab, find the "GIS" database and click it.
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/SQL_Dev_Screenshot_1.jpg"))`
3. When prompted, enter your Oracle username and password
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/SQL_Dev_Screenshot_2.jpg"))`
4. In the "Connections" pane, expand the "GIS" database and navigate down to "Other Users"
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/SQL_Dev_Screenshot_3.jpg"))`
5. Expand "Other Users" and navigate down to "GISDAT"
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/SQL_Dev_Screenshot_4.jpg"))`
6. Within "GISDAT" find OCC tables begining with "OCN" (note as of March 2020, this is soon to be changed to "OCC" prefix when the data team updates the new tables)
