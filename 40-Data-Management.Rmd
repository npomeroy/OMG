# Access the OCC Database

As of April 2020, the OCC team is in the process of working with the data management team to migrate all OCC Team data and metadata to an Oracle database. In order to access this database, a new user must submit an [ITS support ticket](https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/jira/login.jsp?permissionViolation=true&os_destination=%2Fbrowse%2FPICITS-181121%3Ffilter%3D-2&page_caps=&user_role=) to request an Oracle account in addition to requesting an install of SQL Developer. If you'd like to access data via R, you'll also need to request to have ODBC drivers setup. 

## Connect to the OCC Database With R

[Checkout this live SOP on Google Drive for how to get connected to OCC Data in the oracle database](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hVuyRj78kB3NHR4xF-mWZeOZCwYMDNSLSwQc08Af7s/edit#)

## Connect to the OCC Database With SQL Developer

### Installing SQL Developer

1. In the folder “Resources and Software” is the sqldeveloper zip file: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1b4lNP2Hj1C4vonSv7OskAXqYRfZk-DIA

2. Right click the zip file and download.

3. Create a folder in your local documents folder on your device called “SQLDeveloper”
For example I have mine here:

     C:\Users\Brooke.Olenski\Documents\sqldeveloper

4. Move the new downloaded zip to that “SQLDeveloper” folder

5. Right click -> 7-zip -> Extract Here

6. Open the folder that just unzipped called sqldeveloper and scroll down to the application “sqldeveloper.exe”

7. Right click “sqldeveloper.exe” -> send to -> Desktop

**Addtional Notes About SQL Developer (updated April 2020 during data archive training):**

* Is your SQL Developer taking several minutes to load? This is probably due to McAfee scanning it upon opening and bogging it down. To avoid this and make it open quickly, you should put it in the folder that PIFSC ITS has made exempt from McAfee scanning: C:\\sqldeveloper



Please allow ample time to do the download and install. Once installed, log in to VPN and then start up SQL developer so you can connect to the database beforehand. On some computers (mine!) it can take a long time for SQL Dev to open, to connect to the database, and to browse the tables within the database. I'm not sure if that will be your experience or not (our configurations are likely very different)




it ALSO takes a long time to expand the database objects (like GISDAT), sometimes another 5-10 minutes. Once it has expanded, then all usually works ok, but it definitely takes patience for me to get to that point. 

* From Brooke 4/20/2020 email: Right click on your connection GIS_GISDAT and select "reconnect". Then when it reconnects, open the drop down under GIS_GISDAT and right click on "Materialized views" and click "refresh".
If There are any issues in still running your queries please let me know. We also updated the query so it is organized in an easier fashion to QC and submit it. 
Also, only the Hawaii record output was different, all others should be the same as listed in Hannah's document when you do a row count to check your output:

### Annete's Guide to Export Via SQLDeveloper

1. Once SQL Developer is open, right-click on ORACLE CONNECTIONS in the tree to the left of the window and choose NEW CONNECTION.
2. The first screenshot below shows you the options to set up your connection. Replace "ADESROCHERS" with the username you were given to connect to the database (most likely first initial and last name). 
3. Once the parameters are filled in click TEST, which will probably run really quickly.
4. If it worked, the STATUS in the left bottom corner of the connection window should indicate SUCCESS. If so, click CONNECT. 
5. Once that's done, in the WORKSHEET window (the main screen that is totally blank with the tab that has the name of your database connect), copy and paste this statement into the worksheet:  

   SELECT * FROM GISDAT.ISLANDS
   
7. Click the GREEN ARROW pointing to the right to RUN STATEMENT. It will take a few seconds to run. 
8. If successful, the results of the query you ran will be displayed in the QUERY RESULT window below the worksheet where you ran the statement

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/SQLDeveloper_Connect_April_2020_2.jpg"))`

### Export Data for QC Via SQLDeveloper SOP by Brooke

### Noah's January 2020 Procedure for Connecting to the Oracle Database

1. Open Oracle SQL Developer
2. On the "Welcome Page" tab, under the "Databases Detected" tab, find the "GIS" database and click it.
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/SQL_Dev_Screenshot_1.jpg"))`
3. When prompted, enter your Oracle username and password
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/SQL_Dev_Screenshot_2.jpg"))`
4. In the "Connections" pane, expand the "GIS" database and navigate down to "Other Users"
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/SQL_Dev_Screenshot_3.jpg"))`
5. Expand "Other Users" and navigate down to "GISDAT"
`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/SQL_Dev_Screenshot_4.jpg"))`
6. Within "GISDAT" find OCC tables begining with "OCN" (note as of March 2020, this is soon to be changed to "OCC" prefix when the data team updates the new tables)

## How to Archive Data

After data is qc'd it mus be archived. As of January 2020, the best place to look for all information and guidance related to archiving data is in a [google drive folder setup by Annette](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oq76hN6eOhhJOevwZiO0nX4Gtf0tiJrp).
