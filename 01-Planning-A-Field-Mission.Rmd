# Preparing for a Research Cruise {#cruise_prep}

`r knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/Sette_Big_Island_2010_Pomeroy.jpg"))`

## Determine Goals

Determine the team's goals in the region the research cruise is scheduled to visit.  Identify all planned retreivals, deployments and specialty projects (such as the diel suite), and the number of days, staff, and boats needed to accomplish these goals.

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)

sites <- read.csv("data/OCC_LIST_OF_SITES_21-FEB-2020.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

m <- leaflet(sites) %>% addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery") %>%
  addMarkers(~LONGITUDE, ~LATITUDE, popup=sites$OCC_SITEID)

m
```



## Spatial Data Preparation
- Create a single .kml file that includes all planned instrument retrievals and any planned additional deployments and other necessary points (collectively all called “planning points”. .kml files are more agile than ArcGIS files; they are easier to use in Google Earth for day to day planning.
- Create an ArcGIS map project that contains the locations of all planning points.

## Garmin 78 Handheld GPS Preparation
- Ensure each handheld unit is setup properly
  - Time to UTC
  - LAT and LONG in decimal degrees
- Test each handheld GPS to be taken on the cruise prior to sailing: take it outside and ensure that it collects waypoints.
- Upload planning points to both the primary and secondary GPS units.

## Datasheet Preparation

* We should make some new field datasheets before MARAMP2020 given the NEW FANCY Oracle DB!!!!!!!!

* Prepare Field Data Binders
  + Print enough data sheets for all activities, including mooring, CAU, CTD/H2O for the OCC team in addition to enough CTD/H20 data sheets for any other team on CTD/H20 Ops.
  + Attach sharp pencils to field binders
