# Preface {-}

The Ocean and Climate Change Team investigates the impacts of climate change on coral reefs of the US Pacific Islands to inform resilience based management of these important ecosystems.  While working in synchrony with other teams investigating reef ecology, the OCC Team focuses on studying carbonate chemistry, carbonate budgets and ocean warming .

## How to Edit and Access the OMG {-}

# OMG Edit and Access Tutorial

This video walks through the basics of editing and accessing the OMG as of April 2020.  This process is likely to evolve, but it's worth a watch as much of this process will remain the same.

Welcome to the online knowledge base of the OCC Team.  This started as the OCC Mission Guide, a reference manual to help consolidate best practices for conducting OCC team operations at sea.  As of 2020, it has evolved into an online living book, written in R Markdown and compiled into book with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/),published via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The current live version of the book that you can bookmark is [here](https://npomeroy.github.io/OMG/). All OCC team members are encouraged to not only use it as a resource but help it grow by adding and editing content as OCC projects, methods and missions continue to change and grow. Anyone on the team that is a collaborator on the repo may clone it to their local machine and make edits and commits without needing to fork the repo [Noah via GitHub](https://github.com/npomeroy/OMG). Our current workflow uses GitHub desktop to make commits and pull other collaborators changes from the online repo.

 HTML version of the OMG may be accessed offline by simply opening the index.html file in the folder "OMG/docs" A .PDF file of the book is also generated every time the book is built, that also ends up in the "OMG/docs" folder. 

**To Build and Access a Local Version of the OMG on Your Machine**
(prerequisite: you have already cloned the repo to your local machine)

1. Once you have made changes to any .RMD file, click *Build Book* under the *Build* tab in the upper right window pane of R studio.
2. If the book does not automatically open, find the Index.html file in the *docs* subfolder of the *OMG* folder and open it with a browser.
